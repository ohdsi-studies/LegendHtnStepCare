  abstract = {Observational research promises to complement experimental research by providing large, diverse populations that would be infeasible for an experiment. Observational research can test its own clinical hypotheses, and observational studies also can contribute to the design of experiments and inform the generalizability of experimental research. Understanding the diversity of populations and the variance in care is one component. In this study, the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) collaboration created an international data network with 11 data sources from four countries, including electronic health records and administrative claims data on 250 million patients. All data were mapped to common data standards, patient privacy was maintained by using a distributed model, and results were aggregated centrally. Treatment pathways were elucidated for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and depression. The pathways revealed that the world is moving toward more consistent therapy over time across diseases and across locations, but significant heterogeneity remains among sources, pointing to challenges in generalizing clinical trial results. Diabetes favored a single first-line medication, metformin, to a much greater extent than hypertension or depression. About 10% of diabetes and depression patients and almost 25% of hypertension patients followed a treatment pathway that was unique within the cohort. Aside from factors such as sample size and underlying population (academic medical center versus general population), electronic health records data and administrative claims data revealed similar results. Large-scale international observational research is feasible.},

  abstract = {More than 1 billion adults have hypertension globally, of whom 70% cannot achieve their hypertension control goal with monotherapy alone. Data are lacking on clinical use patterns of dual combination therapies prescribed to patients who escalate from monotherapy.To investigate the most common dual combinations prescribed for treatment escalation in different countries and how treatment use varies by age, sex, and history of cardiovascular disease.This cohort study used data from 11 electronic health record databases that cover 118 million patients across 8 countries and regions between January 2000 and December 2019. Included participants were adult patients (ages ≥18 years) who newly initiated antihypertensive dual combination therapy after escalating from monotherapy. There were 2 databases included for 3 countries: the Iqvia Longitudinal Patient Database (LPD) Australia and Electronic Practice-based Research Network 2019 linked data set from South Western Sydney Local Health District (ePBRN SWSLHD) from Australia, Ajou University School of Medicine (AUSOM) and Kyung Hee University Hospital (KHMC) databases from South Korea, and Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH) and National University Hospital (NUH) databases from Singapore. Data were analyzed from June 2020 through August 2021.Treatment with dual combinations of the 4 most commonly used antihypertensive drug classes (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor [ACEI] or angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB]; calcium channel blocker [CCB]; β-blocker; and thiazide or thiazide-like diuretic).The proportion of patients receiving each dual combination regimen, overall and by country and demographic subgroup.Among 970 335 patients with hypertension who newly initiated dual combination therapy included in the final analysis, there were 11 494 patients from Australia (including 9291 patients in Australia LPD and 2203 patients in ePBRN SWSLHD), 6980 patients from South Korea (including 6029 patients in Ajou University and 951 patients in KHMC), 2096 patients from Singapore (including 842 patients in KTPH and 1254 patients in NUH), 7008 patients from China, 8544 patients from Taiwan, 103 994 patients from France, 76 082 patients from Italy, and 754 137 patients from the US. The mean (SD) age ranged from 57.6 (14.8) years in China to 67.7 (15.9) years in the Singapore KTPH database, and the proportion of patients by sex ranged from 24 358 (36.9%) women in Italy to 408 964 (54.3%) women in the US. Among 12 dual combinations of antihypertensive drug classes commonly used, there were significant variations in use across country and patient subgroup. For example starting an ACEI or ARB monotherapy followed by a CCB (ie, ACEI or ARB + CCB) was the most commonly prescribed combination in Australia (698 patients in ePBRN SWSLHD [31.7%] and 3842 patients in Australia LPD [41.4%]) and Singapore (216 patients in KTPH [25.7%] and 439 patients in NUH [35.0%]), while in South Korea, CCB + ACEI or ARB (191 patients in KHMC [20.1%] and 1487 patients in Ajou University [24.7%]), CCB + β-blocker (814 patients in Ajou University [13.5%] and 217 patients in KHMC [22.8%]), and ACEI or ARB + CCB (147 patients in KHMC [15.5%] and 1216 patients in Ajou University [20.2%]) were the 3 most commonly prescribed combinations. The distribution of 12 dual combination therapies were significantly different by age and sex in almost all databases. For example, use of ACEI or ARB + CCB varied from 873 of 3737 patients ages 18 to 64 years (23.4%) to 343 of 2292 patients ages 65 years or older (15.0%) in South Korea’s Ajou University database (P for database distribution by age &lt; .001), while use of ACEI or ARB + CCB varied from 2121 of 4718 (44.8%) men to 1721 of 4549 (37.7%) women in Australian LPD (P for drug combination distributions by sex &lt; .001).In this study, large variation in the transition between monotherapy and dual combination therapy for hypertension was observed across countries and by demographic group. These findings suggest that future research may be needed to investigate what dual combinations are associated with best outcomes for which patients.},

  abstract = {Hypertension is the most common condition seen in primary care and leads to myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, and death if not detected early and treated appropriately. Patients want to be assured that blood pressure (BP) treatment will reduce their disease burden, while clinicians want guidance on hypertension management using the best scientific evidence. This report takes a rigorous, evidence-based approach to recommend treatment thresholds, goals, and medications in the management of hypertension in adults. Evidence was drawn from randomized controlled trials, which represent the gold standard for determining efficacy and effectiveness. Evidence quality and recommendations were graded based on their effect on important outcomes. There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a BP goal of less than 150/90 mm Hg and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90 mm Hg; however, there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal, so the panel recommends a BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg for those groups based on expert opinion. The same thresholds and goals are recommended for hypertensive adults with diabetes or nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) as for the general hypertensive population younger than 60 years. There is moderate evidence to support initiating drug treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, or thiazide-type diuretic in the nonblack hypertensive population, including those with diabetes. In the black hypertensive population, including those with diabetes, a calcium channel blocker or thiazide-type diuretic is recommended as initial therapy. There is moderate evidence to support initial or add-on antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in persons with CKD to improve kidney outcomes. Although this guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the management of high BP and should meet the clinical needs of most patients, these recommendations are not a substitute for clinical judgment, and decisions about care must carefully consider and incorporate the clinical characteristics and circumstances of each individual patient.},

  abstract = {Noting that randomized clinical trials (RCTs) “generally yield the strongest inferences about the effects of medical treatments,”(p984) the AMA Manual of Style instructs that “randomized trials may use terms such as effect and causal relationship,”(p983) In contrast, the manual claims that observational studies “cannot lead to causal inferences”(p994) and thus “should be described in terms of association or correlation and should avoid cause-and-effect wording.”(p983) Nevertheless, analyses of observational data—often consisting of real-world evidence from databases of medical claims and electronic health records—play an increasingly prominent role in health care. Given the well-recognized limitations of observational studies, their growing use to estimate treatment effects is the subject of considerable controversy. Should real-world evidence have a meaningful role in decision-making? In this issue of JAMA, investigators from the RCT DUPLICATE Initiative address this controversy by directly comparing the results of published RCTs to analyses of 3 national claims databases that are carefully designed to emulate the original RCTs. The results of their productive line of research warrant careful consideration.},

Here, we modify the monotherapy definition, imposing exit from cohorts upon addition of another antihypertensive medication. We determine hazard ratios (HR) for 55 safety and effectiveness outcomes over six databases and compare results to earlier findings. We find, for all primary outcomes, statistically significant differences in effectiveness between ACEi and thiazides were not replicated (HRs: 1.11, 1.06, 1.12 for acute myocardial infarction, hospitalization with heart failure and stroke, respectively). While statistical significance is similarly lost for several safety outcomes, the safety profile of thiazides remains more favorable. Our results indicate a less striking difference in effectiveness of thiazides compared to ACEi and reflect some sensitivity to the monotherapy cohort definition modification.},

  abstract = {Evidence for the effectiveness and safety of the third-generation β-blockers other than atenolol in hypertension remains scarce. We assessed the effectiveness and safety of β-blockers as first-line treatment for hypertension using 3 databases in the United States: 2 administrative claims databases and 1 electronic health record–based database from 2001 to 2018. In each database, comparative effectiveness of β-blockers for the risks of acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure was assessed, using large-scale propensity adjustment and empirical calibration. Estimates were combined across databases using random-effects meta-analyses. Overall, 118 133 and 267 891 patients initiated third-generation β-blockers (carvedilol and nebivolol) or atenolol, respectively. The pooled hazard ratios (HRs) of acute myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for heart failure, and most metabolic complications were not different between the third-generation β-blockers versus atenolol after propensity score matching and empirical calibration (HR, 1.07 [95% CI, 0.74–1.55] for acute myocardial infarction; HR, 1.06 [95% CI, 0.87–1.31] for stroke; HR, 1.46 [95% CI, 0.99–2.24] for hospitalized heart failure). Third-generation β-blockers were associated with significantly higher risk of stroke than ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors (HR, 1.29 [95% CI, 1.03–1.72]) and thiazide diuretics (HR, 1.56 [95% CI, 1.17–2.20]). In conclusion, this study found many patients with first-line β-blocker monotherapy for hypertension and no statistically significant differences in the effectiveness and safety comparing atenolol with third-generation β-blockers. Patients on third-generation β-blockers had a higher risk of stroke than those on ACE inhibitors and thiazide diuretics.},

We compared the real-world effectiveness and safety of ACE inhibitors versus ARBs in the first-line treatment of hypertension. We implemented a retrospective, new-user comparative cohort design to estimate hazard ratios using techniques to minimize residual confounding and bias, specifically large-scale propensity score adjustment, empirical calibration, and full transparency. We included all patients with hypertension initiating monotherapy with an ACE inhibitor or ARB between 1996 and 2018 across 8 databases from the United States, Germany, and South Korea. The primary outcomes were acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and composite cardiovascular events. We also studied 51 secondary and safety outcomes including angioedema, cough, syncope, and electrolyte abnormalities. Across 8 databases, we identified 2 297 881 patients initiating treatment with ACE inhibitors and 673 938 patients with ARBs. We found no statistically significant difference in the primary outcomes of acute myocardial infarction (hazard ratio, 1.11 for ACE versus ARB [95% CI, 0.95–1.32]), heart failure (hazard ratio, 1.03 [0.87–1.24]), stroke (hazard ratio, 1.07 [0.91–1.27]), or composite cardiovascular events (hazard ratio, 1.06 [0.90–1.25]). Across secondary and safety outcomes, patients on ARBs had significantly lower risk of angioedema, cough, pancreatitis, and GI bleeding. In our large-scale, observational network study, ARBs do not differ statistically significantly in effectiveness at the class level compared with ACE inhibitors as first-line treatment for hypertension but present a better safety profile. These findings support preferentially prescribing ARBs over ACE inhibitors when initiating treatment for hypertension.},

Outpatient and inpatient care episodes of first-time users of antihypertensive monotherapy in the United States based on 2 administrative claims databases and 1 collection of electronic health records were analyzed. Analysis began June 2018.Chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide.The primary outcomes were acute myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, and a composite cardiovascular disease outcome including the first 3 outcomes and sudden cardiac death. Fifty-one safety outcomes were measured.Of 730 225 individuals (mean [SD] age, 51.5 [13.3] years; 450 100 women [61.6%]), 36 918 were dispensed or prescribed chlorthalidone and had 149 composite outcome events, and 693 337 were dispensed or prescribed hydrochlorothiazide and had 3089 composite outcome events. No significant difference was found in the associated risk of myocardial infarction, hospitalized heart failure, or stroke, with a calibrated hazard ratio for the composite cardiovascular outcome of 1.00 for chlorthalidone compared with hydrochlorothiazide (95% CI, 0.85-1.17). Chlorthalidone was associated with a significantly higher risk of hypokalemia (hazard ratio [HR], 2.72; 95% CI, 2.38-3.12), hyponatremia (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.16-1.47), acute renal failure (HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.15-1.63), chronic kidney disease (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.09-1.42), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.12-1.30). Chlorthalidone was associated with a significantly lower risk of diagnosed abnormal weight gain (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.61-0.86).This study found that chlorthalidone use was not associated with significant cardiovascular benefits when compared with hydrochlorothiazide, while its use was associated with greater risk of renal and electrolyte abnormalities. These findings do not support current recommendations to prefer chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension treatment in first-time users was found. We used advanced methods, sensitivity analyses, and diagnostics, but given the possibility of residual confounding and the limited length of observation periods, further study is warranted.},

  abstract = {Summary Background Uncertainty remains about the optimal monotherapy for hypertension, with current guidelines recommending any primary agent among the first-line drug classes thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, in the absence of comorbid indications. Randomised trials have not further refined this choice. Methods We developed a comprehensive framework for real-world evidence that enables comparative effectiveness and safety evaluation across many drugs and outcomes from observational data encompassing millions of patients, while minimising inherent bias. Using this framework, we did a systematic, large-scale study under a new-user cohort design to estimate the relative risks of three primary (acute myocardial infarction, hospitalisation for heart failure, and stroke) and six secondary effectiveness and 46 safety outcomes comparing all first-line classes across a global network of six administrative claims and three electronic health record databases. The framework addressed residual confounding, publication bias, and p-hacking using large-scale propensity adjustment, a large set of control outcomes, and full disclosure of hypotheses tested. Findings Using 4·9 million patients, we generated 22 000 calibrated, propensity-score-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) comparing all classes and outcomes across databases. Most estimates revealed no effectiveness differences between classes; however, thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics showed better primary effectiveness than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors: acute myocardial infarction (HR 0·84, 95% CI 0·75–0·95), hospitalisation for heart failure (0·83, 0·74–0·95), and stroke (0·83, 0·74–0·95) risk while on initial treatment. Safety profiles also favoured thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics over angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers were significantly inferior to the other four classes. Interpretation This comprehensive framework introduces a new way of doing observational health-care science at scale. The approach supports equivalence between drug classes for initiating monotherapy for hypertension—in keeping with current guidelines, with the exception of thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics superiority to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and the inferiority of non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers.

One influential development has been the “active comparator, new user” study design, which seeks to emulate the design of a head-to-head randomized controlled trial. In this review, we first discuss biases that may affect pharmacoepidemiologic studies and describe their direction and magnitude in a variety of settings. We then present the historical foundations of the active comparator, new user study design and explain how this design conceptually mitigates biases leading to a paradigm shift in pharmacoepidemiology. We offer practical guidance on the implementation of the study design using administrative databases. Finally, we provide an empirical example in which the active comparator, new user study design addresses biases that have previously impeded pharmacoepidemiologic studies.},

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a common study endpoint for drug safety studies that rely on health records from the SDD and other administrative databases. Purpose In this chart validation study, we report on the positive predictive value (PPV) of inpatient International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification AMI administrative diagnosis codes (410.x1 and 410.x0) in the SDD. Methods As part of an assessment of thromboembolic adverse event risk following treatment with intravenous immune globulin, charts were obtained for 103 potential post–intravenous immune globulin AMI cases. Charts were abstracted by trained nurses and physician-adjudicated based on prespecified diagnostic criteria. Results Acute myocardial infarction status could be determined for 89 potential cases. The PPVs for the inpatient AMI diagnoses recorded in the SDD were 75% overall (95% CI, 65-84%), 93% (95% CI, 78-99%) for principal-position diagnoses, 88% (95% CI, 72-97%) for secondary diagnoses, and 38% (95% CI, 20-59%) for position-unspecified diagnoses (eg, diagnoses originating from separate physician claims associated with an inpatient stay). Of the confirmed AMI cases, demand ischemia was the suspected etiology more often for those coded in secondary or unspecified positions (72% and 40%, respectively) than for principal-position AMI diagnoses (21%). Conclusions The PPVs for principal and secondary AMI diagnoses were high and similar to estimates from prior chart validation studies. Position-unspecified diagnosis codes were less likely to represent true AMI cases.},

  abstract = {Abstract Background Electronic health data are routinely used to conduct studies of cardiovascular disease in the setting of the Veterans Health Administration (VA). Previous studies have estimated the positive predictive value (PPV) of International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes for acute myocardial infarction (MI), but the sensitivity of these codes for all true events and the accuracy of coding algorithms for prevalent disease status at baseline are largely unknown. Methods We randomly sampled 180 Veterans from the VA Puget Sound Health Care System who initiated diabetes treatment. The full electronic medical record was reviewed to identify prevalent conditions at baseline and acute MI events during follow-up. The accuracy of various coding algorithms was assessed. Results Algorithms for previous acute events at baseline had high PPV (previous MI: 97%; previous stroke: 81%) but low sensitivity (previous MI: 38%; previous stroke: 52%). Algorithms for chronic conditions at baseline had high PPV (heart failure: 72%; coronary heart disease [CHD]: 85%) and high sensitivity (heart failure: 90%, CHD: 84%). For current smoking status at baseline, ICD-9 codes with pharmacy data had a PPV of 77% and sensitivity of 73%. The coding algorithm for acute MI events during follow-up had high PPV (80%) and sensitivity (89%) Conclusions ICD-9 codes for acute MI events during follow-up had high PPV and sensitivity. The sensitivity of ICD-9 codes for previous acute events at baseline was low, but a composite variable for baseline CHD had good accuracy. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

For acute myocardial infarction (AMI) the extent to which different EHR sources are accessible and accurate remains uncertain. Using MEDLINE and EMBASE we identified thirty three studies, reporting a total of 128658 patients, published between January 2000 and July 2014 that permitted assessment of the validity of AMI diagnosis drawn from EHR sources against a reference such as manual chart review. In contrast to clinical practice, only one study used EHR-derived markers of myocardial necrosis to identify possible AMI cases, none used electrocardiogram findings and one used symptoms in the form of free text combined with coded diagnosis. The remaining studies relied mostly on coded diagnosis. Thirty one studies reported positive predictive value (PPV)≥70% between AMI diagnosis from both secondary care and primary care EHRs and the reference. Among fifteen studies reporting EHR-derived AMI phenotypes, three cross-referenced ST-segment elevation AMI diagnosis (PPV range 71–100%), two non-ST-segment elevation AMI (PPV 91.0, 92.1%), three non-fatal AMI (PPV range 82–92.2%) and six fatal AMI (PPV range 64–91.7%). Clinical coding of EHR-derived AMI diagnosis in primary care and secondary care was found to be accurate in different clinical settings and for different phenotypes. However, markers of myocardial necrosis, ECG and symptoms, the cornerstones of a clinical diagnosis, are underutilised and remain a challenge to retrieve from EHRs.},

  abstract = {Abstract Purpose To validate administrative claims codes with medical chart review for myocardial infarction (MI), ischemic stroke, and severe upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleed events in a large, commercially-insured US population. Methods These validation studies were part of a larger study examining the risk of MI, ischemic stroke, and severe UGI bleeds in patients receiving a new prescription of selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors (coxibs) and non-over-the-counter (OTC) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), between 1 July 2002 and 30 September 2004. Patients from the study cohort and other health plan members from the HealthCore Integrated Research DatabaseSM (HIRD) experiencing these events were selected for these studies. The positive predictive value (PPV) of each of the claims code algorithms, using medical chart review as the gold standard, was calculated. Results Two hundred charts per event were abstracted. The PPV for MI was 88.4% (177/200; 95%CI, 83.2–92.5%); PPV for ischemic stroke was 87.4% (175/200; 95%CI, 82.0–91.7%); PPV for severe UGI bleed was 56.5% (109/193; 95%CI, 49.2–63.6%). Refining the ischemic stroke claims algorithm resulted in a PPV of 95.5% (95%CI, 91.0–98.2%); refining the claims algorithm for severe UGI bleed resulted in a PPV of 87.8% (95%CI, 78.7–94.0%). Conclusion The results suggest that, for certain adverse events, claims data can serve as the basis for pharmacoepidemiology research and drug safety surveillance in the US.

The impact of each comorbidity was expressed as: (1) the risk of mortality for those with the comorbidity, (2) the adjustment to the log odds for 2 year mortality and (3) the age-based likelihood of 2 year mortality. Models were validated by calculating the area under an ROC curve obtained by fitting a logistic regression model to each validation population. The two year mortality rate for 30-day survivors was approximately 30% in each of the 3 cohorts. The 5 most prevalent comorbidities coded in the developmental cohort were heart failure (34%), chronic angina (27%), minor arrythmias (25%) and uncomplicated hypertension (18%). Cancer was the most powerful predictor of 2 year mortality, impacting mortality the same as a 18.3 year age increase. Saturation (having all secondary diagnoses in the discharge summary filled) resulted in a 9.2 year age increase. Validation in the 1988 Medicare and in the Veterans Administration Hospitals cohorts resulted in areas of 73% and 72% under the respective ROC curves. Our methods can serve as a prototype for others wishing to assess comorbidity in other targeted subgroups.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To perform a systematic review of the validity of algorithms for identifying cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) or transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) using administrative and claims data. METHODS: PubMed and Iowa Drug Information Service searches of the English language literature were performed to identify studies published between 1990 and 2010 that evaluated the validity of algorithms for identifying CVAs (ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, intracranial hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage) and/or TIAs in administrative data. Two study investigators independently reviewed the abstracts and articles to determine relevant studies according to pre-specified criteria. RESULTS: A total of 35 articles met the criteria for evaluation. Of these, 26 articles provided data to evaluate the validity of stroke, seven reported the validity of TIA, five reported the validity of intracranial bleeds (intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage), and 10 studies reported the validity of algorithms to identify the composite endpoints of stroke/TIA or cerebrovascular disease. Positive predictive values (PPVs) varied depending on the specific outcomes and algorithms evaluated. Specific algorithms to evaluate the presence of stroke and intracranial bleeds were found to have high PPVs (80% or greater). Algorithms to evaluate TIAs in adult populations were generally found to have PPVs of 70% or greater. CONCLUSIONS: The algorithms and definitions to identify CVAs and TIAs using administrative and claims data differ greatly in the published literature. The choice of the algorithm employed should be determined by the stroke subtype of interest.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The claims data of the Korean National Health Insurance (NHI) system can be useful in stroke research. The aim of this study was to validate the accuracy of hospital discharge data used for NHI claims in identifying acute stroke and use of thrombolytic therapy. METHODS: The hospital discharge data of 1,811 patients with stroke-related diagnosis codes were obtained from Jeju National University Hospital (JNUH) and Seoul Medical Center (SMC). Three algorithms were tested to identify discharges with acute stroke [ischemic stroke (IS), intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), or subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)]: 1) all diagnosis codes up to nine positions, 2) one primary diagnosis and one secondary diagnosis, and 3) only one primary diagnosis code. Reviews of medical records were considered the gold standards. RESULTS: Overall, the degree of agreement (kappa) was higher for algorithms 1 and 2 than for algorithm 3, and the sensitivity and specificity of the first two algorithms for IS and SAH were both >90%, with almost perfect agreement (kappa=0.83-0.84) in the JNUH data set. Regarding ICH, only algorithm 1 yielded an almost perfect agreement (kappa=0.82). In the SMC data set, almost perfect agreement was found for both ICH and SAH in all three algorithms. In contrast, the three algorithms yielded a range of agreement levels, though all substantial, for IS. Almost perfect agreement was obtained for use of thrombolytic therapy in both data sets (kappa=0.91-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: Discharge with hemorrhagic stroke and use of thrombolytic therapy were identified with high reliability in administrative discharge data. A substantial level of agreement was also obtained for IS, despite variation between the algorithms and data sets.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study aimed to validate an algorithm that determines stroke diagnostic code accuracy, in a hospital-based cancer registry, using electronic medical records (EMRs) in Japan. METHODS: The subjects were 27,932 patients enrolled in the hospital-based cancer registry of Osaka University Hospital, between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2015. The ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision) diagnostic codes for stroke were extracted from the EMR database. Specifically, subarachnoid hemorrhage (I60); intracerebral hemorrhage (I61); cerebral infarction (I63); and other transient cerebral ischemic attacks and related syndromes and transient cerebral ischemic attack (unspecified) (G458 and G459), respectively. Diagnostic codes, both "definite" and "suspected," and brain imaging information were extracted from the database. We set the algorithm with the combination of the diagnostic code and/or the brain imaging information, and manually reviewed the presence or absence of the acute cerebrovascular disease with medical charts. RESULTS: A total of 2654 diagnostic codes, 1991 "definite" and 663 "suspected," were identified. After excluding duplicates, the numbers of "definite" and "suspected" diagnostic codes were 912 and 228, respectively. The proportion of the presence of the disease in the "definite" diagnostic code was 22%; this raised 51% with the combination of the diagnostic code and the use of brain imaging information. When adding the interval of when brain imaging was performed (within 30 days and within 1 day) to the diagnostic code, the proportion increased to 84% and 90%, respectively. In the algorithm of "definite" diagnostic code, history of stroke was the most common in the diagnostic code, but in the algorithm of "definite" diagnostic code and the use of brain imaging within 1 day, stroke mimics was the most frequent. CONCLUSIONS: Combining the diagnostic code and clinical examination improved the proportion of the presence of disease in the diagnostic code and achieved appropriate accuracy for research. Clinical research using EMRs require outcome validation prior to conducting a study.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Stroke patients have a high risk for recurrence, which is positively correlated with the number of risk factors. The assessment of risk factors is essential in both stroke outcomes research and the surveillance of stroke burden. However, methods for assessment of risk factors using claims data are not well developed. METHODS: We enrolled 6469 patients with acute ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, or intracerebral hemorrhage from hospital-based stroke registries, which were linked with Taiwan's National Health Insurance (NHI) claims database. We developed algorithms using diagnosis codes and prescription data to identify stroke risk factors including hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation (AF), and coronary artery disease (CAD) in the claims database using registry data as reference standard. We estimated the kappa statistics to quantify the agreement of information on the risk factors between claims and registry data. RESULTS: The prevalence of risk factors in the registries was hypertension 77.0%, diabetes 39.1%, hyperlipidemia 55.6%, AF 10.1%, and CAD 10.9%. The highest kappa statistics were 0.552 (95% confidence interval 0.528-0.577) for hypertension, 0.861 (0.836-0.885) for diabetes, 0.572 (0.549-0.596) for hyperlipidemia, 0.687 (0.663-0.712) for AF, and 0.480 (0.455-0.504) for CAD. Algorithms based on diagnosis codes alone could achieve moderate to high agreement in identifying the selected risk factors, whereas prescription data helped improve identification of hyperlipidemia. CONCLUSIONS: We tested various claims-based algorithms to ascertain important risk factors in stroke patients. These validated algorithms are useful for assessing stroke risk factors in future studies using Taiwan's NHI claims data.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Surveillance for stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) using administrative data has traditionally been limited to reporting patients who had an acute event and were hospitalized. This underestimates the true prevalence because many events do not result in hospitalization. We examined whether the accuracy of administrative data for identifying prevalent stroke/TIA could be improved by using data from both inpatient and outpatient visits. METHODS: An administrative data validation reference standard was developed through chart abstraction of 5000 adult patients randomly sampled from 73,014 patients of 83 family physicians who participate in the Electronic Medical Record Administrative Data Linked Database (EMRALD), in Ontario, Canada. RESULTS: The prevalence of stroke/TIA in our adult population was 3.0%. An algorithm of 1 hospital record had a sensitivity of 35.3% (27.7%-43.0%) and specificity of 99.8% (99.7%-99.9%), whereas an algorithm of 2 physician billings within 1 year or 1 hospitalization had a sensitivity of 68.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 60.5%-75.5%) and specificity of 98.9% (95% CI, 98.6%-99.2%) for the identification of patients who had ever had a stroke/TIA. We found that hospitalization data underestimated the prevalence of stroke by > 50% and TIA by > 66% compared with using both hospitalization and physician claims data. CONCLUSIONS: The use of outpatient physician claims data in addition to hospitalization data improves the sensitivity of administrative data for the identification of prevalent stroke/TIA and may be used to estimate the prevalence of cerebrovascular events in large populations and over time.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Stroke mainly occurs in patients without atrial fibrillation (AF). This study explored risk prediction models for ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) in patients without AF. METHODS: Three US-based healthcare databases (Truven MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters [CCAE], Medicare Supplemental [MDCR], and Optum Clinformatics [Optum]) were used to establish patient cohorts without AF during the index period of 2008-2012. The performance of 2 existing models (CHADS(2) and CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc) for predicting stroke and TIA was examined by fitting a logistic regression to a training dataset and evaluating predictive accuracy in a validation dataset (area under the curve, AUC) using patients with complete follow-up of 1 or 3 years, separately. RESULTS: The commercial populations were younger and had fewer comorbidities than Medicare-eligible population. The incidence proportions of ischemic stroke and TIA during 1 and 3 years of follow-up were .5% and 1.9% (CCAE), .6% and 2.2% (Optum), and 4.6% and 13.1% (MDCR), respectively. The models performed consistently across all 3 databases, with the AUC ranging from .69 to .77 and from .68 to .73 for 1- and 3-year prediction, respectively. Predictive accuracy was lower than the initial work of CHADS(2) evaluation in patients with AF (AUC: .82), but consistent with a subsequent meta-analysis of CHADS(2) (.60-.80) and CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc performance (.64-.79). CONCLUSION: Although the existing schemes for predicting ischemic stroke and TIA in patients with AF can be applied to patients without AF with comparable predictive accuracy, the evidence suggests that there is room for improvement in these models' performance.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Sudden cardiac death (SD) and ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) caused by medications have arisen as an important public health concern in recent years. The validity of diagnostic codes in identifying SD/VA events originating in the ambulatory setting is not well known. This study examined the positive predictive value (PPV) of hospitalization and emergency department encounter diagnoses in identifying SD/VA events originating in the outpatient setting. METHODS: We selected random samples of hospitalizations and emergency department claims with principal or first-listed discharge diagnosis codes indicative of SD/VA in individuals contributing at least 6 months of baseline time within 1999-2002 Medicaid and Medicare data from five large states. We then obtained and reviewed medical records corresponding to these events to serve as the reference standard. RESULTS: We identified 5239 inpatient and 29 135 emergency department events, randomly selected 100 of each, and obtained 119 medical records, 116 of which were for the requested courses of care. The PPVs for an outpatient-originating SD/VA precipitating hospitalization or emergency department treatment were 85.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 77.6-91.2) overall, 79.7% (95%CI = 68.3-88.4) for hospitalization claims, and 93.6% (95%CI = 82.5-98.7) for emergency department claims. CONCLUSIONS: First-listed SD/VA diagnostic codes identified in inpatient or emergency department encounters had very good agreement with clinical diagnoses and functioned well to identify outpatient-originating events. Researchers using such codes can be confident of the PPV when conducting studies of SD/VA originating in the outpatient setting.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Electronic health records databases are increasingly used for identifying cohort populations, covariates, or outcomes, but discerning such clinical 'phenotypes' accurately is an ongoing challenge. We developed a flexible method using overlapping (Venn diagram) queries. Here we describe this approach to find patients hospitalized with acute congestive heart failure (CHF), a sampling strategy for one-by-one 'gold standard' chart review, and calculation of positive predictive value (PPV) and sensitivities, with SEs, across different definitions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used retrospective queries of hospitalizations (2002-2011) in the Indiana Network for Patient Care with any CHF ICD-9 diagnoses, a primary diagnosis, an echocardiogram performed, a B-natriuretic peptide (BNP) drawn, or BNP >500 pg/mL. We used a hybrid between proportional sampling by Venn zone and over-sampling non-overlapping zones. The acute CHF (presence/absence) outcome was based on expert chart review using a priori criteria. RESULTS: Among 79,091 hospitalizations, we reviewed 908. A query for any ICD-9 code for CHF had PPV 42.8% (SE 1.5%) for acute CHF and sensitivity 94.3% (1.3%). Primary diagnosis of 428 and BNP >500 pg/mL had PPV 90.4% (SE 2.4%) and sensitivity 28.8% (1.1%). PPV was <10% when there was no echocardiogram, no BNP, and no primary diagnosis. 'False positive' hospitalizations were for other heart disease, lung disease, or other reasons. CONCLUSIONS: This novel method successfully allowed flexible application and validation of queries for patients hospitalized with acute CHF.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: From a prospective multicentre multicountry clinical trial, we developed and validated risk models to predict prospective all-cause mortality and hospitalizations because of heart failure (HF) in patients with HF. METHODS AND RESULTS: BIOSTAT-CHF is a research programme designed to develop and externally validate risk models to predict all-cause mortality and HF hospitalizations. The index cohort consisted of 2516 patients with HF from 69 centres in 11 European countries. The external validation cohort consisted of 1738 comparable patients from six centres in Scotland, UK. Patients from the index cohort had a mean age of 69 years, 27% were female, 83% were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-III and the mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 31%. The full prediction models for mortality, hospitalization owing to HF, and the combined outcome, yielded c-statistic values of 0.73, 0.69, and 0.71, respectively. Predictors of mortality and hospitalization owing to HF were remarkably different. The five strongest predictors of mortality were more advanced age, higher blood urea nitrogen and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, lower haemoglobin, and failure to prescribe a beta-blocker. The five strongest predictors of hospitalization owing to HF were more advanced age, previous hospitalization owing to HF, presence of oedema, lower systolic blood pressure and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate. Patients from the validation cohort were aged 74 years, 34% were female, 85% were in NYHA class II-III, and mean LVEF was 41%; c-statistic values for the full and compact model were comparable to the index cohort. CONCLUSION: A small number of variables, which are usually readily available in the routine clinical setting, provide useful prognostic information for patients with HF. Predictors of mortality were remarkably different from predictors of hospitalization owing to HF.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Studies that use electronic health data typically identify heart failure (HF) events from hospitalizations with a principal diagnosis of HF. This approach may underestimate the total burden of HF among persons with CKD. We assessed the accuracy of algorithms for identifying validated HF events from hospitalizations and outpatient encounters, and we used this validation information to estimate the rate of HF events in a large CKD population. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We identified a cohort of 15,141 adults age 18-89 years with an eGFR<60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) from 2008 to 2011. Potential HF events during follow-up were randomly sampled for validation with medical record review. Positive predictive values from the validation study were used to estimate the rate of validated HF events in the full cohort. RESULTS: A total of 1864 participants had at least one health care encounter that qualified as a potential HF event during 2.7 years of mean follow-up. Among 313 potential events that were randomly sampled for validation, positive predictive values were 92% for hospitalizations with a principal diagnosis of HF, 32% for hospitalizations with a secondary diagnosis of HF, and 70% for qualifying outpatient HF encounters. Through use of this validation information in the full cohort, the rate of validated HF events estimated from the most comprehensive algorithm that included principal and secondary diagnosis hospitalizations and outpatient encounters was 35.2 events/1000 person-years (95% confidence interval, 33.1 to 37.4), compared with 9.5 events/1000 person-years (95% confidence interval, 8.7 to 10.5) from the algorithm that included only principal diagnosis hospitalizations. Outpatient encounters accounted for 20% of the total number of validated HF events. CONCLUSIONS: In studies that rely on electronic health data, algorithms that include hospitalizations with a secondary diagnosis of HF and outpatient HF encounters more fully capture the burden of HF, although validation of HF events may be necessary with this approach.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The Italian project MATRICE aimed to assess how well cases of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), hypertension, ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and heart failure (HF) and their levels of severity can be automatically extracted from the Health Search/CSD Longitudinal Patient Database (HSD). From the medical records of the general practitioners (GP) who volunteered to participate, cases were extracted by algorithms based on diagnosis codes, keywords, drug prescriptions and results of diagnostic tests. A random sample of identified cases was validated by interviewing their GPs. SETTING: HSD is a database of primary care medical records. A panel of 12 GPs participated in this validation study. PARTICIPANTS: 300 patients were sampled for each disease, except for HF, where 243 patients were assessed. OUTCOME MEASURES: The positive predictive value (PPV) was assessed for the presence/absence of each condition against the GP's response to the questionnaire, and Cohen's kappa was calculated for agreement on the severity level. RESULTS: The PPV was 100% (99% to 100%) for T2DM and hypertension, 98% (96% to 100%) for IHD and 55% (49% to 61%) for HF. Cohen's kappa for agreement on the severity level was 0.70 for T2DM and 0.69 for hypertension and IHD. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that individuals with T2DM, hypertension or IHD can be validly identified in HSD by automated identification algorithms. Automatic queries for levels of severity of the same diseases compare well with the corresponding clinical definitions, but some misclassification occurs. For HF, further research is needed to refine the current algorithm.},

This study examined the real-world comparative effectiveness within the SGLT2i class and compared with non-SGLT2i antihyperglycaemic agents. Materials and methods Data from 4 large US administrative claims databases were used to characterize risk and provide population-level estimates of canagliflozin's effects on hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) and BKLE amputation vs other SGLT2i and non-SGLT2i in T2DM patients. Comparative analyses using a propensity score–adjusted new-user cohort design examined relative hazards of outcomes across all new users and a subpopulation with established cardiovascular disease. Results Across the 4 databases (142 800 new users of canagliflozin, 110 897 new users of other SGLT2i, 460 885 new users of non-SGLT2i), the meta-analytic hazard ratio estimate for HHF with canagliflozin vs non-SGLT2i was 0.39 (95% CI, 0.26-0.60) in the on-treatment analysis. The estimate for BKLE amputation with canagliflozin vs non-SGLT2i was 0.75 (95% CI, 0.40-1.41) in the on-treatment analysis and 1.01 (95% CI, 0.93-1.10) in the intent-to-treat analysis. Effects in the subpopulation with established cardiovascular disease were similar for both outcomes. No consistent differences were observed between canagliflozin and other SGLT2i. Conclusions In this large comprehensive analysis, canagliflozin and other SGLT2i demonstrated HHF benefits consistent with clinical trial data, but showed no increased risk of BKLE amputation vs non-SGLT2i. HHF and BKLE amputation results were similar in the subpopulation with established cardiovascular disease. This study helps further characterize the potential benefits and harms of SGLT2i in routine clinical practice to complement evidence from clinical trials and prior observational studies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heart failure is the predominant cause of hospitalization and amongst the leading causes of death in Germany. However, accurate estimates of prevalence and incidence are lacking. Reported figures originating from different information sources are compromised by factors like economic reasons or documentation quality. METHODS: We implemented a clinical data warehouse that integrates various information sources (structured parameters, plain text, data extracted by natural language processing) and enables reliable approximations to the real number of heart failure patients. Performance of ICD-based diagnosis in detecting heart failure was compared across the years 2000-2015 with (a) advanced definitions based on algorithms that integrate various sources of the hospital information system, and (b) a physician-based reference standard. RESULTS: Applying these methods for detecting heart failure in inpatients revealed that relying on ICD codes resulted in a marked underestimation of the true prevalence of heart failure, ranging from 44% in the validation dataset to 55% (single year) and 31% (all years) in the overall analysis. Percentages changed over the years, indicating secular changes in coding practice and efficiency. Performance was markedly improved using search and permutation algorithms from the initial expert-specified query (F1 score of 81%) to the computer-optimized query (F1 score of 86%) or, alternatively, optimizing precision or sensitivity depending on the search objective. CONCLUSIONS: Estimating prevalence of heart failure using ICD codes as the sole data source yielded unreliable results. Diagnostic accuracy was markedly improved using dedicated search algorithms. Our approach may be transferred to other hospital information systems.},

The International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision ( ICD-9) code, V66.7, can identify palliative care services. However, code validity for specialist palliative care in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has not been determined. OBJECTIVE: To validate the ICD-9 code for specialist palliative care and determine common reasons for specialist palliative care consultation among VHA patients hospitalized with HF. DESIGN: Electronic health record review of data from the Veterans Aging Cohort Study. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: The sample included 100 patients hospitalized with HF from 2003 to 2012. MEASUREMENTS: Data from 50 patients with V66.7 were matched by age, race, site of care, hospital length of stay, intensive care unit admission, and fiscal year of study discharge to 50 patients with HF without V66.7 who had died within a year of hospitalization. We calculated positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV), sensitivity, and specificity. RESULTS: All patients included in the sample were male, 66% black ethnicity, and mean age = 65 years (standard deviations [SD] +/- 10.5 for cases; SD +/- 9.8 for matches). Specialist palliative care was documented for 49 of 50 patients with V66.7 (PPV = 98%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 88-99) and 9 of 50 patients without the code (NPV = 82%, 95% CI: 68-91). Sensitivity was 84% (95% CI: 72-92), and specificity was 98% (95% CI: 86-99). Establishing goals of care was the most frequent reason for palliative care consultation (43% of the sample). CONCLUSION: The ICD-9 code V66.7 identifies specialist palliative care for hospitalized patients with HF in the VHA. Replication of findings in other data sources and populations is needed.},

The benefits and risks associated with ticagrelor vs clopidogrel in routine practice merits attention.To determine the association of ticagrelor vs clopidogrel with ischemic and hemorrhagic events in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for ACS in clinical practice.A retrospective cohort study of patients with ACS who underwent PCI and received ticagrelor or clopidogrel was conducted using 2 United States electronic health record–based databases and 1 nationwide South Korean database from November 2011 to March 2019. Patients were matched using a large-scale propensity score algorithm, and the date of final follow-up was March 2019.Ticagrelor vs clopidogrel.The primary end point was net adverse clinical events (NACE) at 12 months, composed of ischemic events (recurrent myocardial infarction, revascularization, or ischemic stroke) and hemorrhagic events (hemorrhagic stroke or gastrointestinal bleeding). Secondary outcomes included NACE or mortality, all-cause mortality, ischemic events, hemorrhagic events, individual components of the primary outcome, and dyspnea at 12 months. The database-level hazard ratios (HRs) were pooled to calculate summary HRs by random-effects meta-analysis.After propensity score matching among 31 290 propensity-matched pairs (median age group, 60-64 years; 29.3% women), 95.5% of patients took aspirin together with ticagrelor or clopidogrel. The 1-year risk of NACE was not significantly different between ticagrelor and clopidogrel (15.1% [3484/23 116 person-years] vs 14.6% [3290/22 587 person-years]; summary HR, 1.05 [95% CI, 1.00-1.10]; P = .06). There was also no significant difference in the risk of all-cause mortality (2.0% for ticagrelor vs 2.1% for clopidogrel; summary HR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.81-1.16]; P = .74) or ischemic events (13.5% for ticagrelor vs 13.4% for clopidogrel; summary HR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.98-1.08]; P = .32). The risks of hemorrhagic events (2.1% for ticagrelor vs 1.6% for clopidogrel; summary HR, 1.35 [95% CI, 1.13-1.61]; P = .001) and dyspnea (27.3% for ticagrelor vs 22.6% for clopidogrel; summary HR, 1.21 [95% CI, 1.17-1.26]; P &lt; .001) were significantly higher in the ticagrelor group.Among patients with ACS who underwent PCI in routine clinical practice, ticagrelor, compared with clopidogrel, was not associated with significant difference in the risk of NACE at 12 months. Because the possibility of unmeasured confounders cannot be excluded, further research is needed to determine whether ticagrelor is more effective than clopidogrel in this setting.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the risk of outpatient medical claims for UGI symptoms among new users of celecoxib versus ibuprofen, and naproxen. METHODS: The study was conducted using LifeLink, an insurance claims database of approximately 1.8 million employees, dependents, and retirees in the United States. Patients newly treated with a prescription of celecoxib, ibuprofen, or naproxen between June 1, 1999, and June 30, 2001, were included. A patient with an upper GI (UGI) symptom was any individual with an outpatient physician claim for dyspepsia (ICD-9 = 536.8), abdominal pain (789.0), or nausea/vomiting (787.0). Incidence was determined using person-time analysis. Multivariate analyses were conducted using Poisson and Cox regression models. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of patients prescribed celecoxib (n = 68,939), ibuprofen (n = 71,456), or naproxen (n = 50,014). At baseline, celecoxib users were older and more likely to have a history of UGI or cardiovascular conditions. The incidence rate of any UGI symptom was 0.46 per 1,000 patient-days for celecoxib, 0.70 for ibuprofen, and 0.62 for naproxen. After adjusting for confounding factors using Poisson regression, the ibuprofen rate was 48% higher than the celecoxib rate (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.48; 95% CI = 1.39-1.58; p < 0.001), whereas the naproxen rate was 40% higher (IRR = 1.40; 95% CI = 1.31-1.49; p < 0.001). The association between drug use and UGI symptoms was confirmed by Cox regression analysis; the hazard ratios were 1.21 (95% CI = 1.13-1.29; p < 0.001) for ibuprofen and 1.15 (95% CI = 1.07-1.23; p < 0.001) for naproxen relative to celecoxib. Younger age, female sex, medical history of UGI, cardiovascular and renal conditions, and higher baseline average healthcare expenditures for the 12-month period preceding the index prescription were also significantly associated with an increased incidence of UGI symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Celecoxib use is associated with a significantly decreased risk of outpatient physician claims for UGI symptoms compared with commonly used prescription nonspecific nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diagnosis is complex, uncertain, and error-prone. Symptoms such as nonspecific abdominal pain are especially challenging. A diagnostic path consists of diagnostic steps taken from initial presentation until a diagnosis is obtained or the evaluation ends for other reasons. Analysis of diagnostic paths can reveal patterns associated with more timely and accurate diagnosis. Visual analytics can be used to enhance both analysis and comprehension of diagnostic paths. OBJECTIVE: This article applies process-mining methods to extract and visualize diagnostic paths from electronic health records (EHRs). METHODS: Patient features, actions taken (i.e., tests, referrals, etc.), and diagnoses obtained for 501 adult patients (half female, half >/=50 years of age) presenting with abdominal pain were extracted from an EHR database to construct diagnostic paths from a hospital system in suburban Chicago, Illinois, United States. A stable diagnosis was defined as the same diagnosis recorded twice in a 12-month period; a working diagnosis was recorded only once. Three different types of path visualizations were obtained. RESULTS: A stable diagnosis was obtained in 63 (13%) patients after 12 months. In 271 (54%) patients, a working diagnosis was obtained. Mean path duration was 145.3 days (standard deviation, 195.1 days). These 63 patients received 75 stable diagnoses.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Consultations for chronic abdominal pain are frequent in adults and children. A seasonal pattern of abdominal pain consultations with winter predominance was shown in previous pediatric studies; however, no studies have investigated whether such a pattern exists in adult patients. Understanding the differences in seasonal patterns of abdominal pain consultations among adults and children may indicate that either different mechanisms exist for common chronic pain conditions or triggering factors may vary by age. The aim of the study was to investigate whether a seasonal variation in abdominal pain consultation patterns exists among adults and children. METHODS: The number of outpatient consultations among children (5-17 years) and adults (18 years or older) with a diagnosis of abdominal pain of nonspecified origin (International Classification of Diseases-9 code 789.0) from May 2000 to December 2008 was identified in an administrative claims database. The primary outcome measure was the rate of abdominal pain consultations (total number of abdominal pain consultations/total number of distinct patients by monthx1000) by season in children and adults. Seasons were defined as follows: winter (December-February), spring (March-May), summer (June-August), and fall (September-November). A trend test was conducted to determine the degree of linearity in the patterns between the 2 groups. Among children, subanalyses by age 5 to 11 years and 12 to 17 years and sex were conducted. RESULTS: A total of 172.4 million distinct patients (13.4% children, 87.6% adults) were identified in the database between May 2000 and December 2008. During the same time period, 15.6 million patient consultations for abdominal pain were identified (10.1% children, 89.9% adults). Children demonstrated a seasonal pattern in abdominal pain consultations, which best fit a quadratic regression curve, with consultations less common during the summer months. Abdominal pain consultations in adults were linear with no seasonal predominance. The trend in seasonal variation of abdominal pain consultations among children stratified by age and sex remained consistent with the overall child population. CONCLUSIONS: Abdominal pain consultations in children are less common during summer months, whereas no evidence of seasonal pattern of consultation was found in adults. Factors involved in the pathogenesis of abdominal pain in adults and children may differ.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Cushing disease (CD) causes a wide variety of nonspecific symptoms, which may result in delayed diagnosis. It may be possible to uncover unusual combinations of otherwise common symptoms using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes. Our aim was to identify and evaluate dyads of clinical symptoms or conditions associated with CD. METHODS: We conducted a matched case-control study using a commercial healthcare insurance claims database designed to compare the relative risk (RR) of individual conditions and dyad combinations of conditions among patients with CD versus matched non-CD controls. RESULTS: With expert endocrinologist input, we isolated 10 key conditions (localized adiposity, hirsutism, facial plethora, polycystic ovary syndrome, abnormal weight gain, hypokalemia, deep venous thrombosis, muscle weakness, female balding, osteoporosis) with RRs varying from 5.3 for osteoporosis to 61.0 for hirsutism (and infinite RR for localized adiposity). The RRs of dyads of these conditions ranged from 4.1 for psychiatric disorders/serious infections to 128.0 for hirsutism/fatigue in patients with versus without CD. Construction of uncommon dyads resulted in further increases in RRs beyond single condition analyses; for example, osteoporosis alone had an RR of 5.3, which increased to 8.3 with serious infections and to 52.0 with obesity. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that RR of any one of 10 key conditions selected by expert opinion was >/=5 times greater in CD compared to non-CD, and nearly all dyads had RR>/=5. An uncommon dyad of osteoporosis and obesity had an RR of 52.0. If clinicians consider the diagnosis of CD when the highest-risk conditions are seen, identification of this rare disease may improve.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a common and distressing but poorly understood symptom among patients with heart failure (HF). This study sought to evaluate the prevalence, predictors, and prognostic value of clinically documented fatigue in newly diagnosed HF patients from the community. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study consisted of 12,285 newly diagnosed HF patients receiving health care services through the Geisinger Health System, with passive data collection through electronic medical records (EMR). Incident HF, fatigue, and other study variables were derived from coded data within EMRs. A collection of 87 candidate predictors were evaluated to ascertain the strongest independent predictors of fatigue using logistic regression. Patients were followed for all-cause mortality for an average of 4.8 years. The associations between fatigue and 6-month, 12-month, and overall mortality were evaluated via Cox proportional hazards regression models. RESULTS: Clinically documented fatigue was found in 4827 (39%) newly diagnosed HF patients. Depression demonstrated the strongest association with fatigue. Fatigue was often part of a symptom cluster, as other HF symptoms including dyspnea, chest pain, edema, syncope, and palpitations were significant predictors of fatigue. Volume depletion, lower body mass index, and abnormal weight loss were also strong predictors of fatigue. Fatigue was not significantly associated with either 6-month (HR = 1.12, p = 0.16) or overall mortality (HR = 1.00, p = 0.89) in adjusted models. CONCLUSIONS: Fatigue is a commonly documented symptom among newly diagnosed HF patients, and its origins may lie in both psychologic and physiologic factors. Though fatigue did provide a prognostic signal in the short-term, this was largely explained by physiologic confounders. Proper therapeutic remediation of fatigue in HF relies on identifying underlying factors.},

The incidence of all AP and hospitalizations for AP was similar between the two groups.

The Kaplan-Meier curve for time to AP was similar between the two groups, and was not affected by previous exposure to DPP-4 inhibitors. The Cox proportional hazard models showed the incidence of AP was not significantly higher in those receiving DPP-4 inhibitors.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association between exenatide BID use and acute pancreatitis across two claims-based studies. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We pooled two cohort studies within separate commercial health insurance databases. We included initiators of exenatide BID and all other antihyperglycemic drugs without prior pancreatitis from 2005-2008. Poisson regression models provided rate ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the association of exenatide BID with acute pancreatitis adjusted for quintiles of propensity scores. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary inpatient diagnoses of acute pancreatitis with correction for misclassification via a validation sub-study. RESULTS: There were 49,956 initiators of exenatide BID and 692,333 initiators of other antihyperglycemic drugs. Patients in the two studies were similar on many demographic and clinical characteristics. Exenatide BID initiators had a higher prevalence of diagnoses consistent with diabetes complications (e.g. peripheral neuropathy) and cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. hypertension). In both studies, current exenatide BID use was not associated with uncorrected outcomes of acute pancreatitis (pooled RR 1.0; CI 0.8-1.3). PPV correction resulted in a slightly higher point estimate for current use (pooled RR 1.3; CI 1.0-1.7) and past use (pooled RR 1.6; 95% CI 1.2-2.1). CONCLUSIONS: These data are consistent with little or no higher risk of acute pancreatitis associated with current exenatide BID use relative to nonuse. Although previous work identified non-causal mechanisms, an increased incidence of acute pancreatitis following cessation of treatment remains a possibility. Bias due to residual confounding or outcome misclassification may remain, and should be considered a potential explanation for these findings.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To estimate the positive predictive value (PPV) of claims for acute pancreatitis among initiators of antihyperglycemic drugs in commercial health insurance claims data. METHODS: As part of a systematic study of the occurrence of acute pancreatitis among antihyperglycemic drug initiators (N=260,255) within a large US health insurer's claims database, we identified potential cases of acute pancreatitis and confirmed them through medical record review. Potential cases had an International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision diagnosis code for acute pancreatitis (577.0) associated with an inpatient or emergency department claim. We sought 860 medical records to confirm potential cases and received 585 (70%), which were reviewed by a clinical adjudication committee. We estimated the PPV and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of claims for these medical records and a subset that had the diagnosis code listed in the first position of an inpatient claim. RESULTS: The PPV was 0.50 (95% CI 0.44-0.53) for an acute pancreatitis diagnosis code in any position and 0.60 (95% CI 0.55-0.65) if in the first position of an inpatient claim. The estimated PPV varied across strata defined by patient characteristics and was generally lower within strata where potential risk factors for acute pancreatitis were present. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that health insurance claims-based identification of acute pancreatitis might overestimate actual cases and introduce appreciable bias, usually toward the null. Further case confirmation or relative risk correction may be necessary to address potential bias.},

METHODS: We analyzed national health insurance claims data of 67 078 ESRD patients initiating dialysis between 1999 and 2007 in Taiwan. All patients were followed up from the start of their dialysis to first AP diagnosis, death, end of dialysis or 31 December 2008. Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify risk factors. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence rates of AP were 0.6, 1.7, 2.6, 3.4 and 4% at 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 years, respectively. ESRD patients on HD and PD had an AP incidence of 5.11 and 5.86 per 1000 person-years, respectively. Independent risk factors for AP in this population were being elderly, being female, having biliary stones or liver disease, and being on PD. Severe AP occurred in 44.9% of the HD patients and in 36% of the PD patients. Patients with AP on HD had a higher incidence of upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleeding than those on PD (P = 0.002). In contrast, those with AP on PD had a higher incidence of need for total parenteral nutrition (TPN) support than those on HD (P = 0.072). Overall in-hospital mortality was 8.1%. The risk factors for mortality after an AP attack were male gender, increased age, AP severity, and the presence of diabetes mellitus or liver disease. CONCLUSIONS: ESRD patients on PD were at higher risk for AP than those on HD. HD patients with AP attacks had a greater incidence of UGI bleeding and PD patients with AP attacks a more frequent need for TPN support.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Observational studies estimating severe outcomes for paracetamol versus ibuprofen use have acknowledged the specific challenge of channeling bias. A previous study relying on negative controls suggested that using large-scale propensity score (LSPS) matching may mitigate bias better than models using limited lists of covariates. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to assess whether using LSPS matching would enable the evaluation of paracetamol, compared to ibuprofen, and increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, or acute renal failure. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: In a new-user cohort study, we used two propensity score model strategies for confounder controls. One replicated the approach of controlling for a hand-picked list. The second used LSPSs based on all available covariates for matching. Positive and negative controls assessed residual confounding and calibrated confidence intervals. The data source was the Clinical Practices Research Datalink (CPRD). RESULTS: A substantial proportion of negative controls were statistically significant after propensity score matching on the publication covariates, indicating considerable systematic error. LSPS adjustment was less biased, but residual error remained. The calibrated estimates resulted in very wide confidence intervals, indicating large uncertainty in effect estimates once residual error was incorporated. CONCLUSIONS: For paracetamol versus ibuprofen, when using LSPS methods in the CPRD, it is only possible to distinguish true effects if those effects are large (hazard ratio > 2). Due to their smaller hazard ratios, the outcomes under study cannot be differentiated from null effects (represented by negative controls) even if there were a true effect. Based on these data, we conclude that we are unable to determine whether paracetamol is associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, GI bleeding, and acute renal failure compared to ibuprofen, due to residual confounding.},

We compared different approaches to develop an automatic case identification system with high sensitivity to assist manual annotators. METHODS: We used four different machine-learning algorithms to build case identification systems for two data sets, one comprising hepatobiliary disease patients, the other acute renal failure patients. To improve the sensitivity of the systems, we varied the imbalance ratio between positive cases and negative cases using under- and over-sampling techniques, and applied cost-sensitive learning with various misclassification costs. RESULTS: For the hepatobiliary data set, we obtained a high sensitivity of 0.95 (on a par with manual annotators, as compared to 0.91 for a baseline classifier) with specificity 0.56. For the acute renal failure data set, sensitivity increased from 0.69 to 0.89, with specificity 0.59. Performance differences between the various machine-learning algorithms were not large. Classifiers performed best when trained on data sets with imbalance ratio below 10. CONCLUSIONS: We were able to achieve high sensitivity with moderate specificity for automatic case identification on two data sets of electronic medical records. Such a high-sensitive case identification system can be used as a pre-filter to significantly reduce the burden of manual record validation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The development of acute kidney injury (AKI) after cardiac surgery is associated with significant mortality, morbidity, and cost. The last decade has seen major changes in the complexity of cardiac surgical candidates and in the number and type of cardiac surgical procedures being performed. METHODS: Using data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, we determined the annual rates of AKI, AKI requiring dialysis (AKI-D), and inpatient mortality after cardiac surgery in the United States in the years 1999 through 2008. RESULTS: Inpatient mortality with AKI and AKI-D decreased from 27.9% and 45.9%, respectively, in 1999 to 12.8% and 35.3%, respectively, in 2008. Compared with 1999, the odds of AKI and AKI-D in 2008, adjusted for demographic and clinical factors, were 3.30 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.89 to 3.77) and 2.23 (95% CI: 1.78 to 2.80), respectively. Corresponding adjusted odds of death associated with AKI and AKI-D were 0.31 (95% CI: 0.26 to 0.36) and 0.47 (95% CI: 0.34 to 0.65.) Taken together, the attributable risks for death after cardiac surgery associated with AKI and AKI-D increased from 30% and 5%, respectively, in 1999 to 47% and 14%, respectively, in 2008. CONCLUSIONS: In sum, despite improvements in individual patient outcomes over the decade 1999 to 2008, the population contribution of AKI and AKI-D to inpatient mortality after surgery increased over the same period.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Medicare claims data might provide an efficient source for outcomes research in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, in the absence of laboratory data, one would need to identify patients with CKD from diagnosis codes associated with health care claims. The validity of this approach to identify patients with CKD has not been sufficiently studied. METHODS: From chart abstraction, we obtained the first serum creatinine measurement of 1,852 elderly Medicare beneficiaries upon hospitalization for myocardial infarction and estimated each patient's glomerular filtration rate. We then searched all Medicare claims of the preceding year for the presence of a diagnosis code for diabetic nephropathy, hypertensive nephropathy, chronic renal insufficiency, acute renal failure, and miscellaneous other renal diseases. Using the gold standard of an estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (<1.00 mL/s/1.73 m2) for definition of CKD, we calculated the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for each of these diagnoses and combinations of these diagnoses. RESULTS: The sensitivity of individual diagnosis algorithms ranged from 2.7% for diabetic nephropathy to 17.5% for miscellaneous. However, miscellaneous had a lower specificity (95.5%) than all other individual diagnosis algorithms (all > or =99%). Using combinations of these algorithms improved sensitivity up to 26.6%, but at the cost of lower specificity. Positive predictive values generally were high (85.7% to 97.5%), but negative predictive values were low (32.4% to 37.4%). CONCLUSION: High positive predictive values indicate that Medicare claims data can be used to accurately identify patients with CKD for study. However, the utility of such databases for comparison of patients with CKD versus lesser degrees of CKD is limited.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Billing codes are frequently used to identify AKI events in epidemiologic research. The goals of this study were to validate billing code-identified AKI against the current AKI consensus definition and to ascertain whether sensitivity and specificity vary by patient characteristic or over time. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: The study population included 10,056 Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study participants hospitalized between 1996 and 2008. Billing code-identified AKI was compared with the 2012 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) creatinine-based criteria (AKIcr) and an approximation of the 2012 KDIGO creatinine- and urine output-based criteria (AKIcr_uop) in a subset with available outpatient data. Sensitivity and specificity of billing code-identified AKI were evaluated over time and according to patient age, race, sex, diabetes status, and CKD status in 546 charts selected for review, with estimates adjusted for sampling technique. RESULTS: A total of 34,179 hospitalizations were identified; 1353 had a billing code for AKI. The sensitivity of billing code-identified AKI was 17.2% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 13.2% to 21.2%) compared with AKIcr (n=1970 hospitalizations) and 11.7% (95% CI, 8.8% to 14.5%) compared with AKIcr_uop (n=1839 hospitalizations). Specificity was >98% in both cases. Sensitivity was significantly higher in the more recent time period (2002-2008) and among participants aged 65 years and older. Billing code-identified AKI captured a more severe spectrum of disease than did AKIcr and AKIcr_uop, with a larger proportion of patients with stage 3 AKI (34.9%, 19.7%, and 11.5%, respectively) and higher in-hospital mortality (41.2%, 18.7%, and 12.8%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The use of billing codes to identify AKI has low sensitivity compared with the current KDIGO consensus definition, especially when the urine output criterion is included, and results in the identification of a more severe phenotype. Epidemiologic studies using billing codes may benefit from a high specificity, but the variation in sensitivity may result in bias, particularly when trends over time are the outcome of interest.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic kidney disease have worse outcomes after stroke. However, the burden of acute kidney injury after stroke has not been extensively investigated. METHODS: We used MEDLINE and Embase to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies that provided data on the risk of AKI and outcomes in adults after ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Pooled incidence was examined using the Stuart-Ord method in a DerSimonian-Laird model. Pooled Odds Ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for outcomes using a random effects model. This review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42017064588). RESULTS: Eight studies were included, five from the United States, representing 99.9% of included patients. Three studies used established acute kidney injury criteria based on creatinine values to define acute kidney injury and five used International Classification of Diseases coding definitions. Overall pooled incidence was 9.61% (95% confidence interval 8.33-10.98). Incidence for studies using creatinine definitions was 19.51% (95% confidence interval 12.75-27.32%) and for studies using coding definitions 4.63% (95% confidence interval 3.65-5.72%). Heterogeneity was high throughout. Mortality in stroke patients who sustained acute kidney injury was increased (Odds Ratio 2.45; 95% confidence interval 1.47-4.10). Three studies reported risk factors for acute kidney injury. There was sparse information on other outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality in stroke patients who develop acute kidney injury is significantly increased. However the reported incidence of AKI after stroke varies widely and is underestimated using coding definitions. Larger international studies are required to identify potentially preventable factors to reduce acute kidney injury after stroke and improve outcomes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Although several standardized definitions for AKI have been developed, no consensus exists regarding which to use in children. This study applied the Pediatric RIFLE (pRIFLE), AKI Network (AKIN), and Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria to an anonymized cohort of hospitalizations extracted from the electronic medical record to compare AKI incidence and outcomes in intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU pediatric populations. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Observational, electronic medical record-enabled study of 14,795 hospitalizations at the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital between 2006 and 2010. AKI and AKI severity stage were defined by the pRIFLE, AKIN, and KDIGO definitions according to creatinine change criteria; urine output criteria were not used. The incidences of AKI and each AKI stage were calculated for each classification system. All-cause, in-hospital mortality and total hospital length of stay (LOS) were compared at each subsequent AKI stage by Fisher exact and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, respectively. RESULTS: AKI incidences across the cohort according to pRIFLE, AKIN, and KDIGO were 51.1%, 37.3%, and 40.3%. Mortality was higher among patients with AKI across all definitions (pRIFLE, 2.3%; AKIN, 2.7%; KDIGO, 2.5%; P<0.001 versus no AKI [0.8%-1.0%]). Within the ICU, pRIFLE, AKIN, and KDIGO demonstrated progressively higher mortality at each AKI severity stage; AKI was not associated with mortality outside the ICU by any definition. Both in and outside the ICU, AKI was associated with significantly higher LOS at each AKI severity stage across all three definitions (P<0.001). Definitions resulted in differences in diagnosis and staging of AKI; staging agreement ranged from 76.7% to 92.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Application of the three definitions led to differences in AKI incidence and staging. AKI was associated with greater mortality and LOS in the ICU and greater LOS outside the ICU. All three definitions demonstrated excellent interstage discrimination. While each definition offers advantages, these results underscore the need to adopt a single, universal AKI definition.},

The performance characteristics of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes for ARF were assessed against serum creatinine-based definitions of ARF in 97,705 adult discharges from three Boston hospitals in 2004. For ARF-D, ICD-9-CM codes were compared with review of medical records in 150 patients with ARF-D and 150 control patients. As compared with a diagnostic standard of a 100% change in serum creatinine, ICD-9-CM codes for ARF had a sensitivity of 35.4%, specificity of 97.7%, positive predictive value of 47.9%, and negative predictive value of 96.1%. As compared with review of medical records, ICD-9-CM codes for ARF-D had positive predictive value of 94.0% and negative predictive value of 90.0%. It is concluded that administrative databases may be a powerful tool for the study of ARF, although the low sensitivity of ARF codes is an important caveat. The excellent performance characteristics of ICD-9-CM codes for ARF-D suggest that administrative data sets may be particularly well suited for research endeavors that involve patients with ARF-D.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Claims-based analyses report that the incidence of sepsis-associated organ dysfunction is increasing. We examined whether coding practices for acute organ dysfunction are changing over time and if so, whether this is biasing estimates of rising severe sepsis incidence and severity. METHODS: We assessed trends from 2005 to 2013 in the annual sensitivity and incidence of discharge ICD-9-CM codes for organ dysfunction (shock, respiratory failure, acute kidney failure, acidosis, hepatitis, coagulopathy, and thrombocytopenia) relative to standardized clinical criteria (use of vasopressors/inotropes, mechanical ventilation for >/= 2 consecutive days, rise in baseline creatinine, low pH, elevated transaminases or bilirubin, abnormal international normalized ratio or low fibrinogen, and decline in platelets). We studied all adult patients with suspected infection (defined by >/= 1 blood culture order) at two US academic hospitals. RESULTS: Acute organ dysfunction codes were present in 57,273 of 191,695 (29.9%) hospitalizations with suspected infection, most commonly acute kidney failure (60.2% of cases) and respiratory failure (28.9%). The sensitivity of all organ dysfunction codes except thrombocytopenia increased significantly over time. This was most pronounced for acute kidney failure codes, which increased in sensitivity from 59.3% in 2005 to 87.5% in 2013 relative to a fixed definition for changes in creatinine (p = 0.019 for linear trend). Acute kidney failure codes were increasingly assigned to patients with smaller creatinine changes: the average peak creatinine change associated with a code was 1.99 mg/dL in 2005 versus 1.49 mg/dL in 2013 (p <0.001 for linear decline). The mean number of dysfunctional organs in patients with suspected infection increased from 0.32 to 0.59 using discharge codes versus 0.69 to 0.79 using clinical criteria (p < 0.001 for both trends and comparison of the two trends). The annual incidence of hospitalizations with suspected infection and any dysfunctional organ rose an average of 5.9% per year (95% CI 4.3, 7.4%) using discharge codes versus only 1.1% (95% CI 0.1, 2.0 %) using clinical criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Coding for acute organ dysfunction is becoming increasingly sensitive and the clinical threshold to code patients for certain kinds of organ dysfunction is decreasing. This accounts for much of the apparent rise in severe sepsis incidence and severity imputed from claims.},

We developed and evaluated a claims-based definition of death. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used healthcare claims and enrollment data between January 2005 and August 2009 for 195,193 beneficiaries aged 20 to 74 in 3 private health insurance unions. We developed claims-based definitions of death using discharge or disease status and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI). We calculated sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive values (PPVs) using the enrollment data as a gold standard in the overall population and subgroups divided by demographic and other factors. We also assessed bias and precision in two example studies where an outcome was death. The definition based on the combination of discharge/disease status and CCI provided moderate sensitivity (around 60%) and high specificity (99.99%) and high PPVs (94.8%). In most subgroups, sensitivity of the preferred definition was also around 60% but varied from 28 to 91%. In an example study comparing death rates between two anticancer drug classes, the claims-based definition provided valid and precise hazard ratios (HRs). In another example study comparing two classes of anti-depressants, the HR with the claims-based definition was biased and had lower precision than that with the gold standard definition. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The claims-based definitions of death developed in this study had high specificity and PPVs while sensitivity was around 60%. The definitions will be useful in future studies when used with attention to the possible fluctuation of sensitivity in some subpopulations.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The Food and Drug Administration's Mini-Sentinel pilot program initially aims to conduct active surveillance to refine safety signals that emerge for marketed medical products. A key facet of this surveillance is to develop and understand the validity of algorithms for identifying health outcomes of interest from administrative and claims data. This article summarizes the process and findings of the algorithm review of anaphylaxis. METHODS: PubMed and Iowa Drug Information Service searches were conducted to identify citations applicable to the anaphylaxis health outcome of interest. Level 1 abstract reviews and Level 2 full-text reviews were conducted to find articles using administrative and claims data to identify anaphylaxis and including validation estimates of the coding algorithms. RESULTS: Our search revealed limited literature focusing on anaphylaxis that provided administrative and claims data-based algorithms and validation estimates. Only four studies identified via literature searches provided validated algorithms; however, two additional studies were identified by Mini-Sentinel collaborators and were incorporated. The International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes varied, as did the positive predictive value, depending on the cohort characteristics and the specific codes used to identify anaphylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: Research needs to be conducted on designing validation studies to test anaphylaxis algorithms and estimating their predictive power, sensitivity, and specificity.},

OBJECTIVE: To validate an ICD-9-CM-based algorithm for identification of patients with CIU/CSU and thus facilitate claims-based research. METHODS: Patient records were reviewed at 4 US practices. Patients included in the study were from a random sample of those identified by their physician as having CIU/CSU or because they met the following diagnosis-based algorithm: (1) at least 2 outpatient ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes 708.1, 708.8, or 708.9 at least 6 weeks apart or (2) 1 outpatient diagnosis of 708.1, 708.8, or 708.9 and 1 diagnosis of 995.1 at least 6 weeks apart. Data collected included ICD-9-CM codes, diagnoses of urticaria and allergy-related conditions, and medication use. Sensitivity and positive predictive value were calculated. The study was approved by the Western Institutional Review Board. RESULTS: One hundred forty-nine patient records were reviewed (mean age 41.1 years; 73.8% were women; 69.1% were white): 115 were identified with the diagnosis-based algorithm, 90 were patients with "known CIU/CSU", and 56 were in the 2 groups. The mean duration of CIU/CSU was 2.9 to 3.1 years. The 2 cohorts most frequently had diagnoses of idiopathic urticaria, unspecified urticaria, and other specified urticaria. The diagnosis-based algorithm had a positive predictive value of 90.4% and a sensitivity of 71.1%. CONCLUSION: The high positive predictive value suggests that patients identified using the algorithm are highly likely to have CIU/CSU. The 71.1% sensitivity suggests that most patients with CIU/CSU will be identified. The validation statistics support the use of the diagnosis-based algorithm in claims-based research, although future studies could refine the algorithm further.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: We aim to develop and validate the positive predictive value (PPV) of an algorithm to identify anaphylaxis using health plan administrative and claims data. Previously published PPVs for anaphylaxis using International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes range from 52% to 57%. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study using administrative and claims data from eight health plans. Using diagnosis and procedure codes, we developed an algorithm to identify potential cases of anaphylaxis from the Mini-Sentinel Distributed Database between January 2009 and December 2010. A random sample of medical charts (n = 150) was identified for chart abstraction. Two physician adjudicators reviewed each potential case. Using physician adjudicator judgments on whether the case met diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis, we calculated a PPV for the algorithm. RESULTS: Of the 122 patients for whom complete charts were received, 77 were judged by physician adjudicators to have anaphylaxis. The PPV for the algorithm was 63.1% (95%CI: 53.9-71.7%), using the clinical criteria by Sampson as the gold standard. The PPV was highest for inpatient encounters with ICD-9-CM codes of 995.0 or 999.4. By combining only the top performing ICD-9-CM codes, we identified an algorithm with a PPV of 75.0%, but only 66% of cases of anaphylaxis were identified using this modified algorithm. CONCLUSIONS: The PPV for the ICD-9-CM-based algorithm for anaphylaxis was slightly higher than PPV estimates reported in prior studies, but remained low. We were able to identify an algorithm that optimized the PPV but demonstrated lower sensitivity for anaphylactic events.},

METHODS: Patients with claims for moderate-to-severe RA (ICD-9 code 714.x) treated with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs as well as controls without RA matched for age, gender and time in plan were selected from the MarketScan Research Database. Anaemia was identified by ICD-9 codes 280.x, 285.2x, 281.9, 285.9 and 284.8. The prevalence ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) for anaemia among RA patients versus controls were estimated. Overall disease burden was measured using the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (ECI). RESULTS: The prevalence ratio for anaemia in RA patients was 2.2 (95% CI 2.1-2.4). Mean ECI was higher in RA (2.26) compared with control (1.02) patients (p<0.001), and RA patients with anaemia had a higher ECI compared with those without anaemia (3.95 vs. 2.08; p<0.001). Total healthcare costs in RA patients with anaemia were approximately twice those of RA patients without anaemia. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of clinically diagnosed anaemia in RA patients in the claims database was 2.2 times higher than that in the comparable non-RA control group. RA patients with anaemia had significantly higher levels of co-morbidity and healthcare costs than RA patients without anaemia.},

In particular, we show how emergence of anemia can be predicted from medical history within electronic health records. We used the Veterans Affairs Informatics and Computing Infrastructure database to examine a retrospective cohort of 9,738,838 veterans over an 11-year period. Using International Clinical Diagnoses Version 9 codes organized into 25 major diagnostic categories, we measured progression of disease by examining changes in risk over time, interactions in risk of combination of diseases, and elevated risk associated with repeated hospitalization for the same diagnostic category. The maximum risk associated with each diagnostic category was used to predict anemia. The accuracy of the model was assessed using a validation cohort. Age and several diagnostic categories significantly contributed to the prediction of anemia. The largest contributors were health status ([Formula: see text] = -1075, t = -92, p < 0.000), diseases of the endocrine ([Formula: see text] = -1046, t = -87, p < 0.000), hepatobiliary ([Formula: see text] = -1043, t = -72, p < 0.000), kidney ([Formula: see text] = -1125, t = -111, p < 0.000), and respiratory systems ([Formula: see text] = -1151, t = -89, p < 0.000). The AUC for the additive model was 0.751 (confidence interval 74.95%-75.26%). The magnitude of AUC suggests that the model may assist clinicians in determining which patients are likely to develop anemia. The procedures used for examining changes in risk factors over time may also be helpful in other predictive medicine projects.},

METHODS: In this retrospective study we used electronic health record data from the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin to develop a computable phenotype algorithm for sickle cell disease. The algorithm was on the basis of the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes, number of visits, and hospital admissions for sickle cell disease. Using Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside queries, the algorithm was refined in an iterative process. The final algorithm was verified using manual medical records review and by comparison with a gold standard set of confirmed sickle cell cases. The algorithm was then validated at Froedtert Hospital, a neighboring health system for adults. RESULTS: From the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, our computable phenotype algorithm identified patients with confirmed sickle cell disease with a positive predictive value of 99.4% and a sensitivity of 99.4%. Additionally, using data from Froedtert, the computable phenotype algorithm identified patients with confirmed sickle cell disease with a positive predictive value of 95.8% and a sensitivity of 98.3%. CONCLUSIONS: The computable phenotype algorithm developed in this study had a high sensitivity and positive predictive value when identifying patients with sickle cell disease in the electronic health records of the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin and Froedtert, a neighboring health system for adults. Our algorithm allows us to harness data provided by the electronic health record to rapidly and accurately identify patient with sickle cell disease and is a rich resource for future clinical trials.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The robustness of epidemiological research using routinely collected primary care electronic data to support policy and practice for common mental disorders (CMD) anxiety and depression would be greatly enhanced by appropriate validation of diagnostic codes and algorithms for data extraction. We aimed to create a robust research platform for CMD using population-based, routinely collected primary care electronic data. METHODS: We developed a set of Read code lists (diagnosis, symptoms, treatments) for the identification of anxiety and depression in the General Practice Database (GPD) within the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage Databank at Swansea University, and assessed 12 algorithms for Read codes to define cases according to various criteria. Annual incidence rates were calculated per 1000 person years at risk (PYAR) to assess recording practice for these CMD between January 1(st) 2000 and December 31(st) 2009. We anonymously linked the 2799 MHI-5 Caerphilly Health and Social Needs Survey (CHSNS) respondents aged 18 to 74 years to their routinely collected GP data in SAIL. We estimated the sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of the various algorithms using the MHI-5 as the gold standard. RESULTS: The incidence of combined depression/anxiety diagnoses remained stable over the ten-year period in a population of over 500,000 but symptoms increased from 6.5 to 20.7 per 1000 PYAR. A 'historical' GP diagnosis for depression/anxiety currently treated plus a current diagnosis (treated or untreated) resulted in a specificity of 0.96, sensitivity 0.29 and PPV 0.76. Adding current symptom codes improved sensitivity (0.32) with a marginal effect on specificity (0.95) and PPV (0.74). CONCLUSIONS: We have developed an algorithm with a high specificity and PPV of detecting cases of anxiety and depression from routine GP data that incorporates symptom codes to reflect GP coding behaviour. We have demonstrated that using diagnosis and current treatment alone to identify cases for depression and anxiety using routinely collected primary care data will miss a number of true cases given changes in GP recording behaviour. The Read code lists plus the developed algorithms will be applicable to other routinely collected primary care datasets, creating a platform for future e-cohort research into these conditions.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Comorbid depression and anxiety are common in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but few population-based estimates of the burden of depression and anxiety exist. Methods to support population-based studies are needed. We aimed to test the performance of administrative case definitions for depression and anxiety in IBD and to understand what the prevalence estimated using such definitions reflects. METHODS: We linked administrative (health claims) data from the province of Manitoba, Canada with clinical data for 266 persons in the Manitoba IBD Cohort Study. We compared the performance of administrative case definitions for depression and anxiety with (a) diagnoses of depression and anxiety as identified based on the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), which identifies disorders meeting formal diagnostic criteria, and (b) participant report of physician-diagnosed depression or anxiety. RESULTS: Administrative definitions for depression showed moderate agreement with the CIDI (kappa=0.39-0.42). Agreement was higher with participant report of physician-diagnosed depression (kappa=0.54). The lifetime prevalence of depression was 29.3% based on the CIDI, 17.7% based on participant report of physician-diagnosed depression, and 21.8-22.5% based on administrative data. Compared to the CIDI, administrative definitions for anxiety showed fair agreement (kappa=0.21-0.25). The lifetime prevalence of anxiety was 31.2% based on the CIDI, 9.7% based on participant report of physician-diagnosed anxiety, and 24.4-31.9% based on administrative data. CONCLUSIONS: Administrative data may be used for population-level surveillance of depression and anxiety in IBD, although they will not capture undiagnosed or untreated cases.},

Nevertheless, individuals with mental health conditions often do not receive psychotherapy, with variation across provider types. This study sought to examine psychotherapy claims surrounding medication initiation in U.S. children with diagnosed anxiety disorders. METHODS: The study cohort included privately insured children (3-17 years) with a diagnosed anxiety disorder initiating a medication to treat anxiety from 2004 to 2014. We examined psychotherapy claims in the 3 months before and 3 months after medication initiation and described children with multiple (2+) psychotherapy claims per 3-month period. RESULTS: Of the 75,024 children initiating a medication for anxiety (median age = 14 years, 58% female), 35% had multiple psychotherapy claims before medication initiation, with variation by age, anxiety disorder, and psychiatric comorbidity and with little change across time. Psychotherapy claims after medication initiation varied by whether the child had prior psychotherapy: 80% in children with prior psychotherapy and 30% in children without prior psychotherapy claims (44% of children diagnosed by a psychiatrist, 21% of children diagnosed by a pediatrician). CONCLUSION: Many privately insured children do not have claims for psychotherapy before or after pharmacotherapy initiation for anxiety. Findings can inform future research and efforts to ultimately increase appropriate psychotherapy utilization in children with anxiety disorders.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The study was designed to validate use of electronic health records (EHRs) for diagnosing bipolar disorder and classifying control subjects. METHOD: EHR data were obtained from a health care system of more than 4.6 million patients spanning more than 20 years. Experienced clinicians reviewed charts to identify text features and coded data consistent or inconsistent with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Natural language processing was used to train a diagnostic algorithm with 95% specificity for classifying bipolar disorder. Filtered coded data were used to derive three additional classification rules for case subjects and one for control subjects. The positive predictive value (PPV) of EHR-based bipolar disorder and subphenotype diagnoses was calculated against diagnoses from direct semistructured interviews of 190 patients by trained clinicians blind to EHR diagnosis. RESULTS: The PPV of bipolar disorder defined by natural language processing was 0.85. Coded classification based on strict filtering achieved a value of 0.79, but classifications based on less stringent criteria performed less well. No EHR-classified control subject received a diagnosis of bipolar disorder on the basis of direct interview (PPV=1.0). For most subphenotypes, values exceeded 0.80. The EHR-based classifications were used to accrue 4,500 bipolar disorder cases and 5,000 controls for genetic analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Semiautomated mining of EHRs can be used to ascertain bipolar disorder patients and control subjects with high specificity and predictive value compared with diagnostic interviews. EHRs provide a powerful resource for high-throughput phenotyping for genetic and clinical research.},

Design Retrospective analysis of administrative claims data. Data Source State of California Medicaid program (Medi-Cal) claims database. Patients A total of 31,574 adults beginning metoprolol between May 1, 2004, and November 1, 2009, without a pharmacy claim for a β blocker within the previous 6 months of metoprolol initiation; patients with a primary or secondary diagnosis of symptomatic bradycardia, pacemaker, or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement before metoprolol initiation were excluded. Measurements and Main Results The study outcome was the time to first occurrence of emergent bradycardia, measured at an emergency department visit or hospitalization due to diagnosis of symptomatic bradycardia, after metoprolol initiation. We calculated the incidence and compared the risk of emergent bradycardia by using a proportional hazards model that included the metoprolol formulation with adjustment for total daily metoprolol dose and the use of other drugs as time-varying covariates, as well as demographics and comorbidities. Among 31,574 patients starting metoprolol, 18,516 (58.6%) used the IR formulation. The incidence of emergent bradycardia was 19.1/1000 person-years overall but was nearly twice as common in patients using the IR versus the SR formulation (24.1/1000 person-yrs in the IR group versus 12.9/1000 person-yrs in the SR group, unadjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.28–2.56). Adjustment for other drugs also associated with symptomatic bradycardia (cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibitors, class I or III antiarrhythmics, and atrioventricular node–blocking agents), metoprolol dose, and other participant characteristics somewhat attenuated the association (adjusted HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.03–2.13). Conclusion The risk of emergent bradycardia associated with metoprolol initiation was higher with the IR formulation than the SR formulation, although the absolute risk was low.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Ticagrelor increases serum adenosine concentrations, slowing conduction and possibly leading to bradycardia. Clinical trial data have shown numerically, though not statistically significantly, higher rates of bradyarrhythmias with ticagrelor versus clopidogrel. Additionally, recent case reports have further raised concerns for this adverse effect. We explored the association between ticagrelor and hospitalization for bradycardia in a real-world setting. METHODS: We conducted a population-based, nested case-control study of Ontario residents, 66 years of age or older, discharged after a first acute coronary syndrome by linking multiple healthcare databases. Cases included patients hospitalized for bradycardia within 1 year of starting a P2Y12 inhibitor. For each case, we identified 4 controls matched on age, sex, index date, and current use of a P2Y12 inhibitor. The exposure of interest was a prescription for ticagrelor within 90 days, with clopidogrel use as the reference group. RESULTS: From April 2012 to March 2014, we identified 140 cases and 560 controls who met the study criteria. We found no significant association between bradycardia and exposure to ticagrelor relative to clopidogrel in the previous 90 days prior to the index date (adjusted odds ratio 1.06, 95% confidence interval 0.65-2.21). Further adjustment for potential confounders also did not identify a significant association. CONCLUSIONS: Among older patients with a first acute coronary syndrome, use of ticagrelor was not associated with a greater risk of admission for bradycardia relative to clopidogrel.},

We trained and evaluated our AFF models on the EHR data across different time intervals (1, 3, 5 and all years) prior to first documented onset of AFF. We applied several machine learning methods, including naive bayes, support vector machines (SVM), logistic regression and random forests for building AFF prediction models and evaluated these using 10-fold cross-validation approach. On text-based datasets, the best model achieved an F-measure of 60.1%, when applied exclusively to coded data. The combination of textual and coded data achieved comparable performance. The study results attest to the relative merit of utilizing textual data to complement the use of coded data for disease onset prediction modeling.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The objectives of this study were to characterize the validity of algorithms to identify AF from electronic health data through a systematic review of the literature and to identify gaps needing further research. METHODS: Two reviewers examined publications during 1997-2008 that identified patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) from electronic health data and provided validation information. We abstracted information including algorithm sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV). RESULTS: We reviewed 544 abstracts and 281 full-text articles, of which 18 provided validation information from 16 unique studies. Most used data from before 2000, and 10 of 16 used only inpatient data. Three studies incorporated electronic ECG data for case identification or validation. A large proportion of prevalent AF cases identified by ICD-9 code 427.31 were valid (PPV 70%-96%, median 89%). Seven studies reported algorithm sensitivity (range, 57%-95%, median 79%). One study validated an algorithm for incident AF and reported a PPV of 77%. CONCLUSIONS: The ICD-9 code 427.31 performed relatively well, but conclusions about algorithm validity are hindered by few recent data, use of nonrepresentative populations, and a disproportionate focus on inpatient data. An optimal contemporary algorithm would likely draw on inpatient and outpatient codes and electronic ECG data. Additional research is needed in representative, contemporary populations regarding algorithms that identify incident AF and incorporate electronic ECG data.},

Large administrative and claims databases can potentially identify drugs or interactions leading to cardiac arrhythmias. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the evidence supporting the validity of algorithms or codes to identify ventricular arrhythmias using administrative and claims data. METHODS: A search of MEDLINE database is supplemented by manual searches of bibliographies of key relevant articles. We selected all studies in which an administrative and claims data algorithm or code was validated against a medical record. We report the positive predictive value (PPV) for ICD-9 codes compared to medical records. RESULTS: Our search strategy yielded 664 studies, of which only seven met our eligibility criteria. Two additional studies were identified by peer reviewers. The most commonly included databases were Medicare and Medicaid, and the most commonly evaluated ICD-9 codes were 426.x and 427.x. The individual use of ICD-9 codes 427.x yielded a high PPV (78%-100%). The highest PPV was seen when both ICD-9 codes 427.x and 798.x were used (92%). The same codes yielded the highest PPV when found in the principal diagnosis position (100%). CONCLUSIONS: The use of ICD-9 codes 427.x, alone or in combination with code 798.x, in the principal position is appropriate for the identification of ventricular arrhythmias in administrative and claims databases.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Patients who have atrial fibrillation (AF) have an increased risk of stroke, but their absolute rate of stroke depends on age and comorbid conditions. OBJECTIVE: To assess the predictive value of classification schemes that estimate stroke risk in patients with AF. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Two existing classification schemes were combined into a new stroke-risk scheme, the CHADS( 2) index, and all 3 classification schemes were validated. The CHADS( 2) was formed by assigning 1 point each for the presence of congestive heart failure, hypertension, age 75 years or older, and diabetes mellitus and by assigning 2 points for history of stroke or transient ischemic attack. Data from peer review organizations representing 7 states were used to assemble a National Registry of AF (NRAF) consisting of 1733 Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 to 95 years who had nonrheumatic AF and were not prescribed warfarin at hospital discharge. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Hospitalization for ischemic stroke, determined by Medicare claims data. RESULTS: During 2121 patient-years of follow-up, 94 patients were readmitted to the hospital for ischemic stroke (stroke rate, 4.4 per 100 patient-years). As indicated by a c statistic greater than 0.5, the 2 existing classification schemes predicted stroke better than chance: c of 0.68 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65-0.71) for the scheme developed by the Atrial Fibrillation Investigators (AFI) and c of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.71-0.76) for the Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation (SPAF) III scheme. However, with a c statistic of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.80-0.84), the CHADS( 2) index was the most accurate predictor of stroke. The stroke rate per 100 patient-years without antithrombotic therapy increased by a factor of 1.5 (95% CI, 1.3-1.7) for each 1-point increase in the CHADS( 2) score: 1.9 (95% CI, 1.2-3.0) for a score of 0; 2.8 (95% CI, 2.0-3.8) for 1; 4.0 (95% CI, 3.1-5.1) for 2; 5.9 (95% CI, 4.6-7.3) for 3; 8.5 (95% CI, 6.3-11.1) for 4; 12.5 (95% CI, 8.2-17.5) for 5; and 18.2 (95% CI, 10.5-27.4) for 6. CONCLUSION: The 2 existing classification schemes and especially a new stroke risk index, CHADS( 2), can quantify risk of stroke for patients who have AF and may aid in selection of antithrombotic therapy.},

  abstract = {Estimations of angina prevalence were calculated using managed care administrative data and applying 3 angina-related definitions. The definitions comprised angina pectoris diagnosis codes, diagnosis and procedure codes signifying the broader condition of coronary artery disease (CAD), including angina pectoris, and diagnosis codes for the symptom of chest pain. Prevalence rates were calculated in 2000, 2001, and the combined period of 2000 and 2001 for each definition based on the number of members with at least 1 day of eligibility in each period. Results were compared with published estimates and projected to the US population. The prevalence rates per 1000 people for angina pectoris in 2000, 2001, and 2000--2001 were 12.3, 14.0, and 17.5, respectively. The prevalence rate is higher in the combined 2-year period primarily because there is little duplication in patients with angina who appear in both years, but there is significant overlap in the overall (denominator) population eligible in both years. For CAD the rates were 52.2, 59.9, and 65.4, respectively, and for chest pain they were 63.4, 75.8, and 93.4, respectively. Rates were higher in men versus women and in each successive age group. These gender and age results were observed in the projections to the US population. By comparison, the American Heart Association (AHA) estimates angina pectoris prevalence to be 35 per 1000 in 2001. The lower managed care rate for angina pectoris may reflect differences in data capture (ie, self-reported data for AHA vs claims submitted for reimbursement for managed care). AHA estimates are higher for women versus men while the managed care estimates show the opposite trend. Prevalence of angina in the United States is substantial. With the aging of the US population, numbers of patients with angina presenting to the healthcare system can be expected to increase, further adding to the cost burdens facing managed care.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In recent clinical guidelines, individuals with chronic kidney disease are considered to have a similar 10-year absolute risk of cardiovascular death as individuals with diabetes or established cardiovascular disease. There is limited evidence to support this claim. METHODS: We investigated the 10-year risk for cardiovascular death in individuals with moderate or severe chronic kidney disease (glomerular filtration rate of 30-60 or <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2), respectively) in a cohort of primary care health check-ups in Stockholm, Sweden (n = 295,191, 46% women, 4290 cardiovascular deaths during 10 years follow-up). We also assessed the risk associated with diabetes or cardiovascular disease. The inclusion criteria, exposure, study outcome and follow-up period adhered strictly to the definitions of the European Society of Cardiology guidelines. RESULTS: The absolute 10-year risk of cardiovascular death was 3.9% and 14.0% in individuals with moderate and severe chronic kidney disease, respectively, but was substantially lower in women and in younger individuals. The risk in individuals with prevalent diabetes and cardiovascular disease was approximately two and three times higher compared to the risk estimate for moderate chronic kidney disease (hazard ratio (HR) 4.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.8-4.5 and HR 6.2, 95% CI 5.7-6.7 vs. HR 2.3 95% CI 2.0-2.6, respectively) while the risk for individuals with severe chronic kidney disease appeared more congruent to that of diabetes and cardiovascular disease (HR 5.5, 95% CI 3.3-8.9). CONCLUSIONS: Although moderate chronic kidney disease is an independent predictor for an increased 10-year risk of cardiovascular death, only those with severe chronic kidney disease had similar risk to those with diabetes or cardiovascular disease.},

CKD is frequently undiagnosed and patients are unaware, hampering intervention. A tool for accurate and timely identification of CKD from electronic medical records (EMR) could improve healthcare quality and identify patients for research. As members of eMERGE (electronic medical records and genomics) Network, we developed an automated phenotyping algorithm that can be deployed to identify rapidly diabetic and/or hypertensive CKD cases and controls in health systems with EMRs It uses diagnostic codes, laboratory results, medication and blood pressure records, and textual information culled from notes. Validation statistics demonstrated positive predictive values of 96% and negative predictive values of 93.3. Similar results were obtained on implementation by two independent eMERGE member institutions. The algorithm dramatically outperformed identification by ICD-9-CM codes with 63% positive and 54% negative predictive values, respectively.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major and increasing constituent of disease burdens worldwide. Early identification of patients at increased risk of developing CKD can guide interventions to slow disease progression, initiate timely referral to appropriate kidney care services, and support targeting of care resources. Risk prediction models can extend laboratory-based CKD screening to earlier stages of disease; however, to date, only a few of them have been externally validated or directly compared outside development populations. Our objective was to validate published CKD prediction models applicable in primary care. METHODS: We synthesised two recent systematic reviews of CKD risk prediction models and externally validated selected models for a 5-year horizon of disease onset. We used linked, anonymised, structured (coded) primary and secondary care data from patients resident in Salford (population ~234 k), UK. All adult patients with at least one record in 2009 were followed-up until the end of 2014, death, or CKD onset (n = 178,399). CKD onset was defined as repeated impaired eGFR measures over a period of at least 3 months, or physician diagnosis of CKD Stage 3-5. For each model, we assessed discrimination, calibration, and decision curve analysis. RESULTS: Seven relevant CKD risk prediction models were identified. Five models also had an associated simplified scoring system. All models discriminated well between patients developing CKD or not, with c-statistics around 0.90. Most of the models were poorly calibrated to our population, substantially over-predicting risk. The two models that did not require recalibration were also the ones that had the best performance in the decision curve analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Included CKD prediction models showed good discriminative ability but over-predicted the actual 5-year CKD risk in English primary care patients. QKidney, the only UK-developed model, outperformed the others. Clinical prediction models should be (re)calibrated for their intended uses.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: As chronic kidney disease (CKD) is among the most prevalent chronic diseases in the world with various rate of progression among patients, identifying its phenotypic subtypes is important for improving risk stratification and providing more targeted therapy and specific treatments for patients having different trajectories of the disease progression. PROBLEM DEFINITION AND DATA: The rapid growth and adoption of electronic health records (EHR) technology has created a unique opportunity to leverage the abundant clinical data, available as EHRs, to find meaningful phenotypic subtypes for CKD. In this study, we focus on extracting disease severity profiles for CKD while accounting for other confounding factors. PROBABILISTIC SUBTYPING MODEL: We employ a probabilistic model to identify precise phenotypes from EHR data of patients who have chronic kidney disease. Using this model, patient's eGFR trajectory is decomposed as a combination of four different components including disease subtype effect, covariate effect, individual long-term effect and individual short-term effect. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS: The discovered disease subtypes obtained by Probabilistic Subtyping Model for CKD are presented and their clinical relevance is analyzed. DISCUSSION: Several clinical health markers that were found associated with disease subtypes are presented with suggestion for further investigation on their use as risk predictors. Several assumptions in the study are also clarified and discussed. CONCLUSION: The large dataset of EHRs can be used to identify deep phenotypes retrospectively. Directions for further expansion of the model are also discussed.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To ascertain if outpatients with moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD) had their condition documented in their notes in the electronic health record (EHR). DESIGN: Outpatients with CKD were selected based on a reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate and their notes extracted from the Columbia University data warehouse. Two lexical-based classification tools (classifier and word-counter) were developed to identify documentation of CKD in electronic notes. MEASUREMENTS: The tools categorized patients' individual notes on the basis of the presence of CKD-related terms. Patients were categorized as appropriately documented if their notes contained reference to CKD when CKD was present. RESULTS: The sensitivities of the classifier and word-count methods were 95.4% and 99.8%, respectively. The specificity of both was 99.8%. Categorization of individual patients as appropriately documented was 96.9% accurate. Of 107 patients with manually verified moderate CKD, 32 (22%) lacked appropriate documentation. Patients whose CKD had not been appropriately documented were significantly less likely to be on renin-angiotensin system inhibitors or have urine protein quantified, and had the illness for half as long (15.1 vs 30.7 months; p<0.01) compared to patients with documentation. CONCLUSION: Our studies show that lexical-based classification tools can accurately ascertain if appropriate documentation of CKD is present in a EHR. Using this method, we demonstrated under-documentation of patients with moderate CKD. Under-documented patients were less likely to receive CKD guideline recommended care. A tool that prompts providers to document CKD might shorten the time to implementing guideline-based recommendations.},

EHR queries used to capture CKD status, identify comorbid conditions, measure awareness by providers, and track adherence to guideline-concordant processes of care have not been validated. METHODS: We extracted EHR data for primary-care patients with two eGFRcreat 15-59 mL/min/1.73 m;2 at least 90 days apart. Two nephrologists manually reviewed a random sample of 50 charts to determine CKD status, associated comorbidities, and physician awareness of CKD. We also assessed the documentation of a CKD diagnosis with guideline-driven care. RESULTS: Complete data were available on 1767 patients with query-defined CKD of whom 822 (47%) had a CKD diagnosis in their chart. Manual chart review confirmed the CKD diagnosis in 34 or 50 (68%) patients. Agreement between the reviewers and the EHR diagnoses on the presence of comorbidities was good (kappa > 0.70, p < 0.05), except for congestive heart failure, (kappa = 0.45, p < 0.05). Reviewers felt the providers were aware of CKD in 23 of 34 (68%) of the confirmed CKD cases. A CKD diagnosis was associated with higher odds of guideline-driven care including CKD-specific laboratory tests and prescriptions for statins. After adjustment, CKD diagnosis documentation was not significantly associated with ACE/ARB prescription. CONCLUSIONS: Identifying CKD status by historical eGFRs overestimates disease prevalence. A CKD diagnosis in the patient chart was a reasonable surrogate for provider awareness of disease status, but CKD awareness remains relatively low. CKD in the patient chart was associated with higher rates of albuminuria testing and use of statins, but not use of ACE/ARB.},

SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: We compared characteristics and outcomes for individuals with CKD defined using laboratory measurements versus claims data from 6,982 REGARDS (Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke) Study participants who had Medicare fee-for-service coverage. PREDICTORS: Presence of CKD as defined by both the REGARDS Study (CKDREGARDS) and Medicare data (CKDMedicare), presence of CKDREGARDS but not CKDMedicare, and presence of CKDMedicare but not CKDREGARDS, and absence of both CKDREGARDS and CKDMedicare. OUTCOMES: Mortality and incident end-stage renal disease (ESRD). MEASUREMENTS: The research study definition of CKD (CKDREGARDS) included estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60mL/min/1.73m(2) or albumin-creatinine ratio > 30mg/g at the REGARDS Study visit. CKD in Medicare (CKDMedicare) was identified during the 2 years before each participant's REGARDS visit using a claims-based algorithm. RESULTS: Overall, 32% of participants had CKDREGARDS and 6% had CKDMedicare. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of CKDMedicare for identifying CKDREGARDS were 15.5% (95% CI, 14.0%-17.1%), 97.7% (95% CI, 97.2%-98.1%), 75.6% (95% CI, 71.4%-79.5%), and 71.5% (95% CI, 70.4%-72.6%), respectively. Mortality and ESRD incidence rates, expressed per 1,000 person-years, were higher for participants with versus without CKDMedicare (mortality: 72.5 [95% CI, 61.3-83.7] vs 33.3 [95% CI, 31.5-35.2]; ESRD: 16.4 [95% CI, 11.2-21.6] vs 1.3 [95% CI, 0.9-1.6]) and with versus without CKDREGARDS (mortality: 59.9 [95% CI, 55.4-64.4] vs 25.5 [95% CI, 23.6-27.4]; ESRD: 6.8 [95% CI, 5.4-8.3] vs 0.1 [95% CI, 0.0-0.3]). Among participants with CKDREGARDS, those with abdominal obesity, diabetes, anemia, lower eGFR, more outpatient visits, hospitalization, and a nephrologist visit in the 2 years before their REGARDS visit were more likely to have CKDMedicare. LIMITATIONS: CKDREGARDS relied on eGFR and albuminuria assessed at a single visit. CONCLUSIONS: CKD, whether defined in claims or through research study measurements, was associated with increased mortality and ESRD. However, individuals with CKD identified in claims may represent a select high-risk population.},

  abstract = {The introduction of pertussis vaccination in the United States (US) in the 1940s has greatly reduced its burden. However, the incidence of pertussis is difficult to quantify, as many cases are not laboratory-confirmed or reported, particularly in adults. This study estimated pertussis incidence in a commercially insured US population aged <50 years. Data were extracted from IMS' PharMetrics Plus claims database for patients with a diagnosis of pertussis or cough illness using International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) codes, a commercial outpatient laboratory database for patients with a pertussis laboratory test, and the Centers for Disease Control influenza surveillance database. US national pertussis incidence was projected using 3 methods: (1) diagnosed pertussis, defined as a claim for pertussis (ICD-9 033.0, 033.9, 484.3) during 2008-2013; (2) based on proxy pertussis predictive logistic regression models; (3) using the fraction of cough illness (ICD-9 033.0, 033.9, 484.3, 786.2, 466.0, 466.1, 487.1) attributed to laboratory-confirmed pertussis, estimated by time series linear regression models. Method 1 gave a projected annual incidence of diagnosed pertussis of 9/100,000, which was highest in those aged <1 year. Method 2 gave an average annual projected incidence of 21/100,000. Method 3 gave an overall regression-estimated weighted annual incidence of pertussis of 649/100,000, approximately 58-93 times higher than method 1 depending on the year. These estimations, which are consistent with considerable underreporting of pertussis in people aged <50 years and provide further evidence that the majority of cases go undetected, especially with increasing age, may aid in the development of public health programs to reduce pertussis burden.},

Vaccine effectiveness can be estimated using a variety of data sources including diagnostic codes from physician billing claims, public health records, reportable disease and laboratory databases. We sought to determine if diagnostic codes from billing claims (administrative data) are adequately sensitive and specific to identify pertussis cases among patients who had undergone disease-specific laboratory testing. METHODS: Data were extracted for 2004-2014 from a public health communicable disease database that contained data on patients under investigation for B. pertussis (both those who had laboratory tests and those who were epidemiologically linked to laboratory-confirmed cases) in Alberta, Canada. These were deterministically linked using a unique lifetime person identifier to the provincial billing claims database, which contains International Classification of Disease version 9 (ICD-9) diagnostic codes for physician visits. We examined visits within 90 days of laboratory testing. ICD-9 codes 033 (whooping cough), 033.0 (Bordetella pertussis), 033.1 (B. parapertussis), 033.8 (whooping cough, other specified organism), and 033.9 (whooping cough, other unspecified organism) in any of the three diagnostic fields for a claim were classified as being pertussis-specific codes. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values. RESULTS: We identified 22,883 unique patients under investigation for B. pertussis. Of these, 22,095 underwent laboratory testing. Among those who had a laboratory test, 2360 tested positive for pertussis. The sensitivity of a pertussis-specific ICD-9 code for identifying a laboratory-confirmed case was 38.6%, specificity was 76.9%, PPV was 16.0%, and NPV was 91.6%. CONCLUSION: ICD-9 codes from physician billing claims data have low sensitivity and moderate specificity to identify laboratory-confirmed pertussis among persons tested for pertussis.},

Privately insured US children in a large claims database were followed from age 8 months until they 1) experienced a hospitalization for rotavirus or acute gastroenteritis; 2) lost continuous health plan enrollment; 3) turned 20 months of age; or 4) reached the end of the study period. Vaccine effectiveness estimates in preventing rotavirus and acute gastroenteritis hospitalizations were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression, stratified by calendar year and adjusted for birth month. Incidence rate differences were estimated to determine the absolute number of gastroenteritis hospitalizations prevented in the cohort. Among 905,718 children, 51%, 66%, 80%, and 86% received 1 or more doses of rotavirus vaccine in each year from 2007 to 2010. The direct vaccine effectiveness of 1 or more doses of rotavirus vaccine in preventing rotavirus gastroenteritis hospitalizations ranged from 87% to 92% each year. Accounting for indirect protection increased estimates of vaccine effectiveness by an additional 3%-8% among those vaccinated. Failing to account for population-level vaccine benefits in 2010, when circulation of rotavirus was low, could underestimate the sustained impact of the vaccine program.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The economic burden associated with irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) is not well understood. OBJECTIVES: To (a) evaluate total annual all-cause, gastrointestinal (GI)-related, and symptom-related (i.e., IBS, diarrhea, abdominal pain) health care resource use and costs among IBS-D patients in a U.S. commercially insured population and (b) estimate incremental all-cause health care costs of IBS-D patients versus matched controls. METHODS: Patients aged >/= 18 years with 12 months of continuous medical and pharmacy benefit eligibility in 2013 were identified from the Truven Health MarketScan research database. The study sample included patients with >/= 1 medical claim with an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis code in any position for IBS (ICD-9-CM 564.1x) and either (a) >/= 2 claims for diarrhea (ICD-9-CM 787.91, 564.5x) on different service dates in 2013, or (b) >/= 1 claim for diarrhea plus >/= 1 claim for abdominal pain (ICD-9-CM 789.0x) on different service dates in 2013, or (c) >/= 1 claim for diarrhea plus >/= 1 pharmacy claim for a symptom-related prescription on different service dates in 2013. Controls included patients with no claims for IBS, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or symptom-related prescriptions in 2013. Controls were randomly selected and matched with IBS-D patients in a 1:1 ratio based on age (+/- 4 years), gender, geographic location, and health plan type. All-cause health care resource utilization included medical and pharmacy claims for health care services associated with any condition. Total health care costs were defined as the sum of health plan-paid and patient-paid direct health care costs from prescriptions and medical services, including inpatient, emergency department (ED), and physician office visits, and other outpatient services. A total cost approach was used to assess all-cause, GI-related, and symptom-related health care costs for IBS-D patients. An incremental cost approach via generalized linear models was used to assess the excess all-cause costs attributable to IBS-D after adjusting for demographics and general and GI comorbidities. RESULTS: Of 39,306 patients (n = 19,653 each for IBS-D and matched controls) included, mean (+/- SD) age was 47 (+/- 17) years and 76.5% were female. Compared with controls, IBS-D patients had a significantly higher mean annual number of hospitalizations, ED visits, office visits, and monthly (30-day) prescription fills. Mean annual all-cause health care costs for IBS-D patients were $13,038, with over half (58.4%) attributable to office visits and other outpatient services (e.g., diagnostic tests and laboratory or radiology services), and remaining costs attributable to prescriptions (19.5%), inpatient admissions (13.6%), and ED visits (8.5%). GI-related ($3,817) and symptom-related ($1,693) costs were also primarily driven by other outpatient service costs. After adjusting for demographics and comorbidities, incremental annual all-cause costs associated with IBS-D were $2,268 ($9,436 for IBS-D patients vs. $7,169 for matched controls; P < 0.001) per patient/year, of which 78% were from medical costs and 22% were from prescription costs. CONCLUSIONS: IBS-D was associated with a substantial burden in direct costs in this population. Compared with matched controls, IBS-D patients had greater medical service use and incurred significantly more annual all-cause health care costs, even after controlling for demographics and comorbidities. Incremental costs associated with IBS-D were primarily attributable to increased use of medical services rather than pharmacy costs. DISCLOSURES: This study was funded by Allergan.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study (NCT01682005) aims to assess clinical and cost impacts of complete and incomplete rotavirus (RV) vaccination. METHODS: Beneficiaries who continuously received medical and pharmacy benefits since birth were identified separately in Truven Commercial Claims and Encounters (2000-2011) and Truven Medicaid Claims (2002-2010) and observed until the first of end of insurance eligibility or five years. Infants with >/=1 RV vaccine within the vaccination window (6 weeks-8 months) were divided into completely and incompletely vaccinated cohorts. Historically unvaccinated (before 2007) and contemporarily unvaccinated (2007 and after) cohorts included children without RV vaccine. Claims with International Classification of Disease 9th edition (ICD-9) codes for diarrhea and RV were identified. First RV episode incidence, RV-related and diarrhea-related healthcare resource utilization after 8 months old were calculated and compared across groups. Poisson regressions were used to generate incidence rates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Mean total, inpatient, outpatient and emergency room costs for first RV and diarrhea episodes were calculated; bootstrapping was used to construct 95% CIs to evaluate cost differences. RESULTS: 1,069,485 Commercial and 515,557 Medicaid patients met inclusion criteria. Among commercially insured, RV incidence per 10,000 person-years was 3.3 (95% CI 2.8-3.9) for completely, 4.0 (95% CI 3.3-5.0) for incompletely vaccinated, and 20.9 (95% CI 19.5-22.4) for contemporarily and 40.3 (95% CI 38.6-42.1) for historically unvaccinated. Rates in Medicaid were 7.5 (95% CI 4.8-11.8) for completely, 9.0 (95% CI 6.5-12.3) for incompletely vaccinated, and 14.6 (95% CI 12.8-16.7) for contemporarily and 52.0 (95% CI 50.2-53.8) for historically unvaccinated. Mean cost for first RV episode per cohort member was $15.33 (95% CI $12.99-$18.03) and $4.26 ($95% CI $2.34-$6.35) lower for completely vaccinated versus contemporarily unvaccinated in Commercial and Medicaid, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: RV vaccination results in significant reduction in RV infection. There is evidence of indirect benefit to unvaccinated individuals.},

Agreement using Cohen's kappa; multivariate logistic regression. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The proportion varied substantially among the data sources. Agreement was poor (kappa: 0.14-0.46 depending upon comparison assessed); the individuals identified had relatively modest overlap. CONCLUSIONS: Estimates of dementia occurrence based on cognitive status measures from three independent data sources were not interchangeable. Further validation of these sources is needed.

To overcome the limitations of prospective studies and self-reported recall of information, the use of existing data is key. This review provides a narrative account of dementia ascertainment methods using sources of existing data. METHODS: The literature search was performed using: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychInfo and Web of Science. Included articles reported a UK-based study of dementia in which cases were ascertained using existing data. Existing data included that which was routinely collected and that which was collected for previous research. After removing duplicates, abstracts were screened and the remaining articles were included for full-text review. A quality tool was used to evaluate the description of the ascertainment methodology. RESULTS: Of the 3545 abstracts screened, 360 articles were selected for full-text review. 47 articles were included for final consideration. Data sources for ascertainment included: death records, national datasets, research databases and hospital records among others. 36 articles used existing data alone for ascertainment, of which 27 used only a single data source. The most frequently used source was a research database. Quality scores ranged from 7/16 to 16/16. Quality scores were better for articles with dementia ascertainment as an outcome. Some papers performed validation studies of dementia ascertainment and most indicated that observed rates of dementia were lower than expected. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a lack of consistency in dementia ascertainment methodology using existing data. With no data source identified as a "gold-standard", we suggest the use of multiple sources. Where possible, studies should access records with evidence to confirm the diagnosis. Studies should also calculate the dementia ascertainment rate for the population being studied to enable a comparison with an expected rate.},

We developed electronic search algorithms to identify cognitive impairment and dementia from the electronic medical records (EMRs) that provide opportunity for big data analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eligible patients met 2 criteria. First, they had a formal cognitive evaluation by The Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. Second, they were hospitalized in intensive care unit at our institution between 2006 and 2014. The "criterion standard" for diagnosis was formal cognitive evaluation supplemented by input from an expert neurologist. Using all available EMR data, we developed and improved our algorithms in the derivation cohort and validated them in the independent validation cohort. RESULTS: Of 993 participants who underwent formal cognitive testing and were hospitalized in intensive care unit, we selected 151 participants at random to form the derivation and validation cohorts. The automated electronic search algorithm for cognitive impairment was 94.3% sensitive and 93.0% specific. The search algorithms for dementia achieved respective sensitivity and specificity of 97% and 99%. EMR search algorithms significantly outperformed International Classification of Diseases codes. CONCLUSIONS: Automated EMR data extractions for cognitive impairment and dementia are reliable and accurate and can serve as acceptable and efficient alternatives to time-consuming manual data review.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Population-based surveillance of Alzheimer's and related dementias (AD-RD) incidence and prevalence is important for chronic disease management and health system capacity planning. Algorithms based on health administrative data have been successfully developed for many chronic conditions. The increasing use of electronic medical records (EMRs) by family physicians (FPs) provides a novel reference standard by which to evaluate these algorithms as FPs are the first point of contact and providers of ongoing medical care for persons with AD-RD. OBJECTIVE: We used FP EMR data as the reference standard to evaluate the accuracy of population-based health administrative data in identifying older adults with AD-RD over time. METHODS: This retrospective chart abstraction study used a random sample of EMRs for 3,404 adults over 65 years of age from 83 community-based FPs in Ontario, Canada. AD-RD patients identified in the EMR were used as the reference standard against which algorithms identifying cases of AD-RD in administrative databases were compared. RESULTS: The highest performing algorithm was "one hospitalization code OR (three physician claims codes at least 30 days apart in a two year period) OR a prescription filled for an AD-RD specific medication" with sensitivity 79.3% (confidence interval (CI) 72.9-85.8%), specificity 99.1% (CI 98.8-99.4%), positive predictive value 80.4% (CI 74.0-86.8%), and negative predictive value 99.0% (CI 98.7-99.4%). This resulted in an age- and sex-adjusted incidence of 18.1 per 1,000 persons and adjusted prevalence of 72.0 per 1,000 persons in 2010/11. CONCLUSION: Algorithms developed from health administrative data are sensitive and specific for identifying older adults with AD-RD.},

The objectives of this study were to use linked administrative databases in the province of Saskatchewan to determine the 12-month incidence and prevalence of dementia for the 2012/13 period (1) among individuals aged 45 and older in the province of Saskatchewan, (2) according to age group and sex, and (3) according to diagnosis code and other case definition criteria. METHODS: We used a population-based retrospective cohort study design and extracted data from 10 provincial health databases linked by a unique health services number. The cohort included individuals 45 years and older at first identification of dementia between April 1, 2001 and March 31, 2013 based on case definitions met within any one of four administrative health databases (Hospital Discharge Abstracts, Physician Service Claims, Prescription Drug, and RAI-MDS, i.e., Long-term Care). RESULTS: A total of 3,270 incident cases of dementia (7.28 per 1,000 PAR) and 13,012 prevalent cases (28.16 per 1,000 PAR) were identified during 2012/13. This study found the incidence rate increased by 2.8 to 5.1 times and the prevalence rate increased by 2.6 to 4.6 times every 10 years after 45 years of age. Overall, the age-standardised incidence rate was significantly lower among females than males (7.04 vs. 7.65 per 1,000 PAR) and the age-standardised prevalence rate was significantly higher among females than males (28.92 vs. 26.53 per 1,000 PAR). Over one-quarter (28 %) of all incident cases were admitted to long-term care before a diagnosis was formally recorded in physician or hospital data, and nearly two-thirds of these cases were identified at admission with impairment at the moderate to very severe level or a disease category of Alzheimer's disease/other dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Linking multiple sources of registry data contributes to our understanding of the epidemiology of dementia across multiple segments of the population, inclusive of individuals residing in long-term care. This information is foundational for public awareness and policy recommendations, health promotion and prevention strategies, appropriate health resource planning, and research priorities.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of the study is to assess the validity of codes or algorithms used to identify dementia in UK electronic health record (EHR) primary care and hospitalisation databases. METHODS: Relevant studies were identified by searching the MEDLINE/EMBASE databases from inception to June 2018, hand-searching reference lists, and consulting experts. The search strategy included synonyms for "Dementia", "Europe", and "EHR". Studies were included if they validated dementia diagnoses in UK primary care or hospitalisation databases, irrespective of validation method used. The Quality Assessment for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool was used to assess risk of bias. RESULTS: From 1469 unique records, 14 relevant studies were included. Thirteen validated individual diagnoses against a reference standard, reporting high estimates of validity. Most reported only the positive predictive value (PPV), with estimates ranging between 0.09 and 1.0 and 0.62 and 0.85 in primary care and hospitalisation databases, respectively. One study performed a rate comparison, indicating good generalisability of dementia diagnoses in The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database to the UK population. Studies were of low methodological quality. As studies were not comparable, no summary validity estimates were produced. CONCLUSION: While heterogenous across studies, reported validity estimates were generally high. However, the credibility of these estimates is limited by the methodological quality of studies, primarily resulting from insufficient blinding of researchers interpreting the reference test. Inadequate reporting, particularly of the specific codes validated, hindered comparison of estimates across studies. Future validation studies should make use of more robust reference tests, follow established reporting guidelines, and calculate all measures of validity.},

The purpose of this study was to develop and validate case definitions and case-finding algorithms used to identify 8 common chronic conditions in primary care: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dementia, depression, diabetes, hypertension, osteoarthritis, parkinsonism, and epilepsy. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional data validation study design, regional and local CPCSSN networks from British Columbia, Alberta (2), Ontario, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland participated in validating EHR case-finding algorithms. A random sample of EHR charts were reviewed, oversampling for patients older than 60 years and for those with epilepsy or parkinsonism. Charts were reviewed by trained research assistants and residents who were blinded to the algorithmic diagnosis. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPVs, NPVs) were calculated. RESULTS: We obtained data from 1,920 charts from 4 different EHR systems (Wolf, Med Access, Nightingale, and PS Suite). For the total sample, sensitivity ranged from 78% (osteoarthritis) to more than 95% (diabetes, epilepsy, and parkinsonism); specificity was greater than 94% for all diseases; PPV ranged from 72% (dementia) to 93% (hypertension); NPV ranged from 86% (hypertension) to greater than 99% (diabetes, dementia, epilepsy, and parkinsonism). CONCLUSIONS: The CPCSSN diagnostic algorithms showed excellent sensitivity and specificity for hypertension, diabetes, epilepsy, and parkinsonism and acceptable values for the other conditions. CPCSSN data are appropriate for use in public health surveillance, primary care, and health services research, as well as to inform policy for these diseases.},

Electronic medical records (EMRs) at 3 family practice clinics in St. John's, NL, Canada, were audited; 253 depressive disorder cases and 257 patients not diagnosed with a depressive disorder were selected. The EMR served as the "gold standard," which then was compared to these same patients investigated through the use of various case definitions applied against the provincial hospital and physician administrative databases. Variables used in the development of the case definitions were depressive disorder diagnoses (either in hospital or physician claims data), date of diagnosis, and service provider type [general practitioner (GP) vs. psychiatrist]. Of the 120 case definitions investigated, 26 were found to have a kappa statistic greater than 0.6, of which 5 case definitions were considered the most appropriate for surveillance of depressive disorders. Of the 5 definitions, the following case definition, with a 77.5% sensitivity and 93% specificity, was found to be the most valid ([ >/=1 hospitalizations OR >/=1 psychiatrist visit related to depressive disorders any time] OR >/=2 GP visits related to depressive disorders within the first 2 years of diagnosis). This study found that provincial administrative databases may be useful for carrying out surveillance on depressive disorders among the adult population. The approach used in this study was simple and resulted in rather reasonable sensitivity and specificity.},

TRD definitions include assessments of treatment response, dose and duration, and implementing these definitions in claims databases can be challenging. We built a data-driven TRD definition and evaluated its performance. METHODS: We included adults with depression, >/=1 antidepressant, and no diagnosis of mania, dementia, or psychosis. Subjects were stratified into those with and without proxy for TRD. Proxies for TRD were electroconvulsive therapy, deep brain, or vagus nerve stimulation. The index date for subjects with proxy for TRD was the procedure date, and for subjects without, the date of a randomly selected visit. We used three databases. We fit decision tree predictive models. We included number of distinct antidepressants, with and without adequate doses and duration, number of antipsychotics and psychotherapies, and expert-based definitions, 3, 6, and 12 months before index date. To assess performance, we calculated area under the curve (AUC) and transportability. RESULTS: We analyzed 33,336 subjects with no proxy for TRD, and 3,566 with the proxy. Number of antidepressants and antipsychotics were selected in all periods. The best model was at 12 months with an AUC = 0.81. The rule transported well and states that a subject with >/=1 antipsychotic or >/=3 antidepressants in the last year has TRD. Applying this rule, 15.8% of subjects treated for depression had TRD. CONCLUSION: The definition that best discriminates between subjects with and without TRD considers number of distinct antidepressants (>/=3) or antipsychotics (>/=1) in the last year.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Depression is the most common mental health disorder and mediates outcomes for many chronic diseases. Ability to accurately identify and monitor this condition, at the local level, is often limited to estimates from national surveys. This study sought to compare and validate electronic health record (EHR)-based depression surveillance with multiple data sources for more granular demographic subgroup and subcounty measurements. DESIGN/SETTING: A survey compared data sources for the ability to provide subcounty (eg, census tract [CT]) depression prevalence estimates. Using 2011-2012 EHR data from 2 large health care providers, and American Community Survey data, depression rates were estimated by CT for Denver County, Colorado. Sociodemographic and geographic (residence) attributes were analyzed and described. Spatial analysis assessed for clusters of higher or lower depression prevalence. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Depression prevalence estimates by CT. RESULTS: National and local survey-based depression prevalence estimates ranged from 7% to 17% but were limited to county level. Electronic health record data provided subcounty depression prevalence estimates by sociodemographic and geographic groups (CT range: 5%-20%). Overall depression prevalence was 13%; rates were higher for women (16% vs men 9%), whites (16%), and increased with age and homeless patients (18%). Areas of higher and lower EHR-based, depression prevalence were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Electronic health record-based depression prevalence varied by CT, gender, race/ethnicity, age, and living status. Electronic health record-based surveillance complements traditional methods with greater timeliness and granularity. Validation through subcounty-level qualitative or survey approaches should assess accuracy and address concerns about EHR selection bias. Public health agencies should consider the opportunity and evaluate EHR system data as a surveillance tool to estimate subcounty chronic disease prevalence.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Because the collection of mental health information through interviews is expensive and time consuming, interest in using population-based administrative health data to conduct research on depression has increased. However, there is concern that misclassification of disease diagnosis in the underlying data might bias the results. Our objective was to determine the validity of International Classification of Disease (ICD)-9 and ICD-10 administrative health data case definitions for depression using review of family physician (FP) charts as the reference standard. METHODS: Trained chart reviewers reviewed 3362 randomly selected charts from years 2001 and 2004 at 64 FP clinics in Alberta (AB) and British Columbia (BC), Canada. Depression was defined as presence of either: 1) documentation of major depressive episode, or 2) documentation of specific antidepressant medication prescription plus recorded depressed mood. The charts were linked to administrative data (hospital discharge abstracts and physician claims data) using personal health numbers. Validity indices were estimated for six administrative data definitions of depression using three years of administrative data. RESULTS: Depression prevalence by chart review was 15.9-19.2% depending on year, region, and province. An ICD administrative data definition of '2 depression claims with depression ICD codes within a one-year window OR 1 discharge abstract data (DAD) depression diagnosis' had the highest overall validity, with estimates being 61.4% for sensitivity, 94.3% for specificity, 69.7% for positive predictive value, and 92.0% for negative predictive value. Stratification of the validity parameters for this case definition showed that sensitivity was fairly consistent across groups, however the positive predictive value was significantly higher in 2004 data compared to 2001 data (78.8 and 59.6%, respectively), and in AB data compared to BC data (79.8 and 61.7%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Sensitivity of the case definition is often moderate, and specificity is often high, possibly due to undercoding of depression. Limitations to this study include the use of FP charts data as the reference standard, given the potential for missed or incorrect depression diagnoses. These results suggest that that administrative data can be used as a source of information for both research and surveillance purposes, while remaining aware of these limitations.},

METHODS: We sought to assess vaccination coverage among fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare beneficiaries with ESRD who received Part B dialysis services at any point from January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2015 (through June 30, 2016 for influenza). To assess influenza vaccination rates in a given influenza season, we restricted the population to beneficiaries who were continuously enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B throughout all twelve months of that season. To assess hepatitis B and pneumococcal vaccine coverage following dialysis initiation, we developed a Kaplan-Meier curve for all patients who began dialysis between 2006 and 2015. RESULTS: For influenza vaccination, we identified an average of approximately 325,000 ESRD dialysis beneficiaries enrolled through each influenza season from 2006-2015. Seasonal influenza vaccination rates steadily increased during the 10-year period, from 52% in 2006-2007 to 71% in 2015-2016. The greatest increases in influenza vaccination appear in non-white beneficiaries with overall utilization in non-whites higher than in whites (p < .001). For the hepatitis B and pneumococcal vaccinations, we identified over 350,000 ESRD dialysis beneficiaries who began dialysis over the 10-year study window. The probability of receiving a hepatitis B vaccine within the first three years of entering into the ESRD program was higher (77%) than the probability of receiving any pneumococcal vaccine (53%). 45% of ESRD patients completed at least one dose of the two hepatitis B series (three-dose or four-dose) at any time during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Opportunities exist at regional and facility levels to improve vaccination coverage. Compliance to ACIP recommendations may directly affect risk for ESRD dialysis patients for complications from diseases that can be mitigated by vaccination.},

Here, we derive and validate a predictive model for falls based on a retrospective cohort of those 65 years and older. METHODS: Insurance claims from a 1-year observational period were used to predict a fall-related claim in the following 2 years. The predictive model takes into account a person's age, sex, prescriptions, and diagnoses. Through random assignment, half of the people had their claims used to derive the model, while the remaining people had their claims used to validate the model. RESULTS: Of 120,881 individuals with Aetna health insurance coverage, 12,431 (10.3%) members fell. During validation, people were risk stratified across 20 levels, where those in the highest risk stratum had 10.5 times the risk as those in the lowest stratum (33.1% vs 3.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Using only insurance claims, individuals in this large cohort at high risk of falls could be readily identified up to 2 years in advance. Although external validation is needed, the findings support the use of the model to better target interventions.},

This study aimed to develop and validate a claims-based frailty index (CFI). METHODS: We used data from Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey 2006 (development sample: n = 5,593) and 2011 (validation sample: n = 4,424). A CFI was developed using the 2006 claims data to approximate a survey-based frailty index (SFI) calculated from the 2006 survey data as a reference standard. We compared CFI to combined comorbidity index (CCI) in the ability to predict death, disability, recurrent falls, and health care utilization in 2007. As validation, we calculated a CFI using the 2011 claims data to predict these outcomes in 2012. RESULTS: The CFI was correlated with SFI (correlation coefficient: 0.60). In the development sample, CFI was similar to CCI in predicting mortality (C statistic: 0.77 vs. 0.78), but better than CCI for disability, mobility impairment, and recurrent falls (C statistic: 0.62-0.66 vs. 0.56-0.60). Although both indices similarly explained the variation in hospital days, CFI outperformed CCI in explaining the variation in skilled nursing facility days. Adding CFI to age, sex, and CCI improved prediction. In the validation sample, CFI and CCI performed similarly for mortality (C statistic: 0.71 vs. 0.72). Other results were comparable to those from the development sample. CONCLUSION: A novel frailty index can measure the risk for adverse health outcomes that is not otherwise quantified using demographic characteristics and traditional comorbidity measures in Medicare data.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A major preventable contributor to healthcare costs among older individuals is fall-related injury. We sought to validate a tool to stratify such risk based on readily available clinical data, including projected medication adverse effects, using state-wide medical claims data. DESIGN: Sociodemographic and clinical features were drawn from health claims paid in the state of Massachusetts for individuals aged 35-65 with a hospital admission for a period spanning January-December 2012. Previously developed logistic regression models of hospital readmission for fall-related injury were refit in a testing set including a randomly selected 70% of individuals, and examined in a training set comprised of the remaining 30%. Medications at admission were summarised based on reported adverse effect frequencies in published medication labelling. SETTING: The Massachusetts health system. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 68 764 hospitalised individuals aged 35-65 years. PRIMARY MEASURES: Hospital readmission for fall-related injury defined by claims code. RESULTS: A total of 2052 individuals (3.0%) were hospitalised for fall-related injury within 90 days of discharge, and 3391 (4.9%) within 180 days. After recalibrating the model in a training data set comprised of 48 136 individuals (70%), model discrimination in the remaining 30% test set yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.74 (95% CI 0.72 to 0.76). AUCs were similar across age decades (0.71 to 0.78) and sex (0.72 male, 0.76 female), and across most common diagnostic categories other than psychiatry. For individuals in the highest risk quartile, 11.4% experienced fall within 180 days versus 1.2% in the lowest risk quartile; 57.6% of falls occurred in the highest risk quartile. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis of state-wide claims data demonstrates the feasibility of predicting fall-related injury requiring hospitalisation using readily available sociodemographic and clinical details. This translatable approach to stratification allows for identification of high-risk individuals in whom interventions are likely to be cost-effective.},

METHODS: We compared incidence rates of peptic ulcer and upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage in 68 028 people younger than 65 years who used diclofenac sodium, naproxen, piroxicam, or sulindac, and who were members of a network of health maintenance organizations. We reviewed automated insurance claims data and medical records to ascertain cases and included conditions treated on an outpatient basis. RESULTS: Medical claims data were adequate for crude identification of potential cases, but review of medical records led to rejection of 63% of these, representing either no abnormality or diseases other than peptic ulcer or upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Of the total 112 cases, 64 (57%) were treated as outpatients. The crude incidence rate per 1000 person-years in users of any current, recent, or past NSAID was 2.2 and in distant-past users of NSAIDs was 0.75. For diclofenac, naproxen, piroxicam, and sulindac, we found a consistent pattern of decreasing NSAID effects from current to recent to past exposure. The risk of peptic ulcer or upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage was 1.6 cases per 1000 people using NSAIDs. CONCLUSIONS: Combining use of automated claims records with review of medical records promotes efficiency while maintaining specificity of case ascertainment. This study, with 57% of cases treated as outpatients, had results consistent with other published reports that were based on hospitalized patients. Within the limits of statistical error, the incidence rates of peptic ulcer and upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage appeared to be similar for the various NSAIDs studied.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The identification of upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleeding and perforated ulcers in claims data typically relies on inpatient diagnoses. The use of hemoglobin laboratory results might increase the detection of UGI events that do not lead to hospitalization. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to evaluate whether hemoglobin results increase UGI outcome identification in electronic databases, using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as a test case. METHODS: From three data partner sites within the Mini-Sentinel Distributed Database, we identified NSAID initiators aged >/=18 years between 2008 and 2013. Numbers of events and risks within 30 days after NSAID initiation were calculated for four mutually exclusive outcomes: (1) inpatient UGI diagnosis of bleeding or gastric ulcer (standard claims-based definition without laboratory results); (2) non-inpatient UGI diagnosis AND >/=3 g/dl hemoglobin decrease; (3) >/=3 g/dl hemoglobin decrease without UGI diagnosis in any clinical setting; (4) non-inpatient UGI diagnosis, without >/=3 g/dl hemoglobin decrease. RESULTS: We identified 2,289,772 NSAID initiators across three sites. Overall, 45.3% had one or more hemoglobin result available within 365 days before or 30 days after NSAID initiation; only 6.8% had results before and after. Of 7637 potential outcomes identified, outcome 1 accounted for 21.7%, outcome 2 for 0.8%, outcome 3 for 34.3%, and outcome 4 for 43.3%. Potential cases identified by outcome 3 were largely not suggestive of UGI events. Outcomes 1, 2, and 4 had similar distributions of specific UGI diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS: Using available hemoglobin result values combined with non-inpatient UGI diagnoses identified few additional UGI cases. Non-inpatient UGI diagnostic codes may increase outcome detection but would require validation.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Incidence rate (IR) estimates for peptic ulcer disease (PUD) vary widely among studies. We conducted a systematic review to quantify and examine the discrepancies. METHODS: Of 4780 articles identified from PubMed and EMBASE databases, 31 published in the last three decades that had reported IRs of PUD in the general population were included. Random effects meta-analysis and meta-regression were performed to calculate pooled estimates and to identify sources of heterogeneity. RESULTS: The pooled IR estimate per 1000 person-years was 0.90 (95% confidence interval: 0.78-1.04) for uncomplicated PUD, 0.57 (0.49-0.65) for peptic ulcer bleeding, 0.10 (0.08-0.13) for gastrointestinal perforations, and 3.18 (2.05-4.92) for nonspecific PUD. Within specific outcomes definitions, IR estimates were significantly lower in studies with restriction to hospitalized cases, case validation, and case ascertainment directly from hospital or clinical sources versus computerized health care databases. Younger age, female sex, and later calendar time were also associated with lower PUD incidence. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the IR of uncomplicated PUD was in the order of one case per 1000 person-years in the general population, and that the IR of peptic ulcer complications was around 0.7 cases per 1000 person-years. Comparisons of IR estimates among studies need to take into account disease definition and other study characteristics, particularly whether outcome validation was performed in computerized claims. The use of claims to identify PUD cases might overestimate the IR by around 45%.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To validate, using physician review of abstracted medical chart data as a gold standard, a claims-based algorithm developed to identify gastrointestinal (GI) perforation cases among rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. METHODS: Patients with established RA, aged 18 years or older with hospital admissions between January 2004 and September 2009, were selected from a large US-hospital-based database. An algorithm with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis codes for GI perforation and combinations of GI-related diagnosis codes and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT-4) procedure codes for relevant GI surgeries was used to identify potential GI perforation cases. Two senior experienced specialist physicians independently reviewed abstracted chart data and classified cases as confirmed or unconfirmed GI perforations. Positive predictive values (PPVs) to identify confirmed GI perforation were calculated and stratified by upper versus lower GI tract. RESULTS: Overall, 86 of 92 GI perforation cases were confirmed, yielding an overall PPV of 94% (95%confidence interval [CI] = 86%-98%). PPV was 100% (95%CI = 100%-100%) for upper GI perforation (esophagus, stomach) and 91% (95%CI = 90%-97%) for lower GI perforation (small intestine, PPV = 100%; large intestine, PPV = 94%; unspecified lower GI, PPV = 89%). CONCLUSIONS: This algorithm, consisting of a combination of ICD-9-CM diagnosis and CPT-4 codes, could be used in future safety studies to evaluate GI perforation risk factors in RA patients.},

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted a validation study in four European electronic health-care record (EHR) databases such as Integrated Primary Care Information (IPCI), Health Search/CSD Patient Database (HSD), ARS, and Aarhus, in which we identified UGIB cases using free text or disease codes: (1) International Classification of Disease (ICD)-9 (HSD, ARS); (2) ICD-10 (Aarhus); and (3) International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) (IPCI). From each database, we randomly selected and manually reviewed 200 cases to calculate positive predictive values (PPVs). We employed different case definitions to assess the effect of outcome misclassification on estimation of risk of drug-related UGIB. RESULTS: PPV was 22% [95% confidence interval (CI): 16, 28] and 21% (95% CI: 16, 28) in IPCI for free text and ICPC codes, respectively. PPV was 91% (95% CI: 86, 95) for ICD-9 codes and 47% (95% CI: 35, 59) for free text in HSD. PPV for ICD-9 codes in ARS was 72% (95% CI: 65, 78) and 77% (95% CI: 69, 83) for ICD-10 codes (Aarhus). More specific definitions did not have significant impact on risk estimation of drug-related UGIB, except for wider CIs. CONCLUSIONS: ICD-9-CM and ICD-10 disease codes have good PPV in identifying UGIB from EHR; less granular terminology (ICPC) may require additional strategies. Use of more specific UGIB definitions affects precision, but not magnitude, of risk estimates.},

  abstract = {Objective Epidemiological data on genitourinary infections (GUIs) comparing patients with and without type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is scant. We aimed to estimate the incidence of urinary tract infections (UTIs), genital infections (GIs), or any GUI in total and stratified by history of GUI and sex. Research design and methods We identified 39,295 patients in the Kaiser Permanente Northwest health plan with T2DM and an equal number of age and sex matched patients without diabetes. The cohort was followed for up to 9years (2006–2014). We calculated incidence rates and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) of any GUI, UTIs and GIs adjusting for age, sex, race, BMI, presence of chronic kidney disease, annual number of outpatient visits, and diuretic use. Results Adjusted incidence of any GUI was 97.2/1000person-years (p-y) (95% CI 95.5–98.8) among the T2DM cohort vs. 79.7/1000 p-y (78.3–81.2) among those without diabetes. T2DM was associated with an adjusted 25% increased risk of UTI (rate ratio 1.25, 95% CI 1.22–1.29), a 26% increased risk of GI (1.26, 1.22–1.31) and a 22% increased risk of any GUI (1.22, 1.19–1.25). Incidence rates were lower among those with no GUI history, but the relative risks were similar. Women in both groups had higher incidence rates of GUIs than men. Conclusions T2DM was associated with increased risks of any GUI, UTIs and GIs. Incidence rates of UTIs were higher than rates of GIs, but the relative risk of GIs was essentially identical. A similar pattern was observed when stratifying by sex. Significance of the study •Limited research suggests the risk of genitourinary infections is greater among patients with diabetes compared with nondiabetic individuals.•Our findings confirm the elevated risk of genitourinary infections and further show that the risk is greater among women and persist when limiting the analysis to patients with no prior history of genitourinary infections.•Clinicians should be alert to the increased risk of genitourinary infections especially among patients with newly diagnosed diabetes and long-term exposure to hyperglycemia. Research questions •Exposure to hyperglycemia may be a more important risk factor for new cases of genitourinary infections vs. historically recurrent cases among patients with diabetes, a possibility that warrants further investigation.•More research is needed to determine whether hyperglycemia increases the risk of new genitourinary infections in a dose/time-dependent manner.•The extent to which genitourinary infections increase the risk of chronic kidney disease needs more study.},

The aim of this study was to determine the performance of case definitions of gout using the limited items available in multipurpose cohorts for population-based genetic studies. METHODS: This research was conducted using the UK Biobank Resource. Data, including genome-wide genotypes, were available for 105,421 European participants aged 40-69 years without kidney disease. Gout definitions and combinations of these definitions were identified from previous epidemiological studies. These definitions were tested for association with 30 urate-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by logistic regression, adjusted for age, sex, waist circumference, and ratio of waist circumference to height. Heritability estimates under an additive model were generated using GCTA version 1.26.0 and PLINK version 1.90b3.32 by partitioning the genome. RESULTS: There were 2066 (1.96%) cases defined by self-report of gout, 1652 (1.57%) defined by urate-lowering therapy (ULT) use, 382 (0.36%) defined by hospital diagnosis, 1861 (1.76%) defined by hospital diagnosis or gout-specific medications and 2295 (2.18%) defined by self-report of gout or ULT use. Association with gout at experiment-wide significance (P < 0.0017) was observed for 13 SNPs with gout using the self-report of gout or ULT use definition, 12 SNPs using the self-report of gout definition, 11 SNPs using the hospital diagnosis or gout-specific medication definition, 10 SNPs using ULT use definition and 3 SNPs using hospital diagnosis definition. Heritability estimates ranged from 0.282 to 0.308 for all definitions except hospital diagnosis (0.236). CONCLUSIONS: Of the limited items available in multipurpose cohorts, the case definition of self-report of gout or ULT use has high sensitivity and precision for detecting association in genetic epidemiological studies of gout.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Diagnostic codes based on medical records or claims data have been used to identify patient populations with gout for important epidemiologic and clinical studies. We evaluated whether we can document the accuracy of such diagnoses by review of medical records and then on direct interviews with a subset of patients. METHODS: Electronic medical records of 289 patients with 2 visits with ICD-9 codes for gout were extensively reviewed to search for documentation of features that would classify patients as having gout by 3 sets of proposed criteria, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), New York, or Rome criteria. Records of patients who had been seen by rheumatologists were compared with all others. A subset of patients seen in clinic were directly interviewed for comparison with the results from the records. RESULTS: Based on medical records review there was documentation of gout by the ACR criteria in only 36%, Rome criteria in 30%, and New York criteria in 33%. Records of patients who had seen rheumatologists had better documentation of classification features. Interview in clinic of 37 patients also improved documentation of the 3 sets of criteria features of gout in 65%-81% of those with ICD-9 codes for gout. CONCLUSION: We found it difficult to confirm ICD-9 coded diagnoses of gout using currently available proposed criteria from details recorded in medical records. This may reflect a problem with available criteria and with documentation. Direct interview of patients may be needed to confirm the presence of typical features when high specificity is desired.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Gout is a common inflammatory arthritis characterized by repeated acute flares. The ability to accurately identify gout flares is critical for comparative effectiveness studies of gout treatments. We developed and examined the accuracy of a claims-based algorithm to identify gout flares. METHODS: Patients receiving care at an academic medical center between 2006 and 2010 with a diagnosis of gout or hyperuricemia were selected using an electronic medical record-Medicare claims linked dataset. Gout flares were identified by several claims-based algorithms using a diagnosis of gout combined with gout-related medication claims and/or procedure codes for arthrocentesis or joint injection. We calculated positive predictive value of these algorithms based on physician documentation of gout flare in medical record as the gold standard. Negative predictive value of the gout flare algorithm was calculated in a randomly selected subgroup of 200 patients with gout. RESULTS: Among 3952 subjects with gout or hyperuricemia, 503 flares were identified using the medication-based algorithm, and 290 were identified using the procedure-based algorithm. The positive predictive value for gout flares ranged from 50-54% for the medication-based algorithms and 59-68% for the procedure-based algorithms. The negative predictive value of the algorithm combining both medication and procedure claims was high (85.2%). CONCLUSION: Use of gout diagnosis codes in combination with medication dispensing or procedure codes did not appear to accurately capture gout flares in patients with gout in a claims database. However, the claims-based flare algorithm could be useful in identifying a cohort of gout patients with no flares. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the utility of using administrative data for epidemiologic studies of gout by examining the validity of gout diagnoses in claims data. METHODS: From a population of approximately 800,000 members from 4 managed care plans, we identified patients who had at least 2 ambulatory claims for a diagnosis of gout between January 1, 1999 and December 31, 2003. From this group, a random sample of 200 patients was chosen for medical record review. Trained medical record reviewers abstracted gout-related clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data from the medical records. Two rheumatologists independently evaluated the abstracted information and assessed whether the gout diagnosis was probable/definite or unlikely/insufficient information. Discordant physician ratings were adjudicated by consensus. Based on record reviews, patients were also classified according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), Rome, and New York gout criteria and these results were compared with the physician global assessments. RESULTS: There were 121 patients rated as having probable/definite gout by physician consensus, leading to a positive predictive value of >or=2 coded diagnoses of gout of 61% (95% confidence interval 53-67). There was low concordance between physician assessments and established gout criteria including ACR, Rome, and New York criteria (kappa = 0.17, 0.16, and 0.20, respectively). CONCLUSION: Use of administrative data alone in epidemiologic and health services research on gout may lead to misclassification. Medical record reviews for validation of claims data may provide an inadequate gold standard to confirm gout diagnoses.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cluster headache (CH) is uncommon, so electronic searches of large medical record databases provide an important opportunity to identify a sufficient number of patients for research, patient registries, or quality improvement work. However, the accuracy of CH diagnoses recorded in electronic health record (EHR) databases is unknown. The Research Patient Data Registry (RPDR) warehouses information from EHR of two academic medical centers in Boston. We assessed the validity of CH diagnoses in the RPDR as well as the sensitivity of International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) diagnostic criteria in relation to the gold standard of expert clinician diagnosis of CH. METHODS: In 2013, we queried RPDR to identify all patients diagnosed with CH diagnosed by headache specialists from 2002 to 2012. We sought to determine the positive predictive value (PPV) of an EHR diagnosis of CH relative to a headache expert's clinical impression as the gold standard. We also calculated the sensitivity of ICHD-2 CH criteria compared with the gold standard of expert-diagnosed CH cases. RESULTS: RPDR queries identified 170 patients with a diagnosis of CH. Two researchers carried out a detailed chart review searching for information to support or refute this diagnosis. In 58 cases, the diagnosis of CH was determined to be inaccurate due to data entry errors. The PPV of an RPDR diagnosis of CH was 63% (95% CI 54-71%) and the sensitivity of ICHD-2 criteria compared with the gold standard of expert diagnosis was 77% (95% CI 69-82%). CONCLUSIONS: The PPV of EHR diagnoses of CH is modest. Data entry errors are common, and only about three-fourths of CH cases diagnosed by expert clinicians meet ICHD criteria for CH. Thus, EHR searches for patients with CH frequently will result in false positives. This has implications for activities such as research, quality improvement efforts, or disease registries that rely on EHR searches to identify patients. Further work is needed to develop high quality phenotypic algorithms so that the research potential of EHRs can be realized.},

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of claims data from the North Carolina State Health Plan for Teachers and State Employees from 2000 to 2009. Data were extracted from Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina for the North Carolina State Health Plan using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, diagnostic codes for headache. The claims were separated by individual provider type, combination of provider types, and referral patterns. RESULTS: The majority of patients and claims were in the MD-only or MD plus referral patterns. Chiropractic patterns represented less than 10% of patients. Care patterns with single-provider types and no referrals incurred the least charges on average for headache. When care did not include referral providers or services, MD with DC care was generally less expensive than MD care with PT. However, when combined with referral care, MD care with PT was generally less expensive. Compared with MD-only care, risk-adjusted charges (available 2006-2009) for patients in the middle risk quintile were significantly less for DC-only care. CONCLUSIONS: Utilization and expenditures for headache treatment increased from 2000 to 2009 across all provider groups. MD care represented the majority of total allowed charges in this study. MD care and DC care, alone or in combination, were overall the least expensive patterns of headache care. Risk-adjusted charges were significantly less for DC-only care.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to develop an automated causality assessment algorithm to identify drug-induced liver injury. METHODS: The Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM) is an algorithm for determining the causal association between a drug and liver injury. In collaboration with hepatology experts, definitions were developed for the RUCAM criteria to operationalize an electronic RUCAM (eRUCAM). The eRUCAM was tested in a population of patients taking 14 drugs with a characteristic phenotype for liver injury. Quality assurance for programming specifications involved comparisons between scores generated by the eRUCAM, for probable and highly probable cases, and expert manual RUCAM (n = 20). Concordance between eRUCAM and manual RUCAM subscores and total score was tested using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULTS: Causality scores were the same for 6 of 20 patients (30%) by manual and eRUCAM algorithms. Analysis of subscores revealed >/=80% concordance between manual and eRUCAM for five of the seven criteria. In general, the total scores tended to be higher for the eRUCAM compared with the manual RUCAM. Programming issues were identified for criterion 5 'non-drug causes of liver injury' where significant differences existed between manual and eRUCAM scoring (p = 0.001). For criterion 5, identical scores occurred in 9 of 20 patients (45%), and manual review identified additional codes, timing criteria, and laboratory results for improving subsequent eRUCAM revisions. CONCLUSION: The eRUCAM had generally good concordance with manual RUCAM scoring. These preliminary findings suggest that the eRUCAM algorithm is feasible and could have application in clinical practice and drug safety surveillance.},

METHODS: We analyzed types and causes of differences in DILI case definitions provided by two institutions-Columbia University and Mayo Clinic; harmonized two EHR phenotyping algorithms; and assessed the performance, measured by sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value, of the resulting algorithm at three institutions except that sensitivity was measured only at Columbia University. RESULTS: Although these sites had the same case definition, their phenotyping methods differed by selection of liver injury diagnoses, inclusion of drugs cited in DILI cases, laboratory tests assessed, laboratory thresholds for liver injury, exclusion criteria, and approaches to validating phenotypes. We reached consensus on a DILI phenotyping algorithm and implemented it at three institutions. The algorithm was adapted locally to account for differences in populations and data access. Implementations collectively yielded 117 algorithm-selected cases and 23 confirmed true positive cases. DISCUSSION: Phenotyping for rare conditions benefits significantly from pooling data across institutions. Despite the heterogeneity of EHRs and varied algorithm implementations, we demonstrated the portability of this algorithm across three institutions. The performance of this algorithm for identifying DILI was comparable with other computerized approaches to identify adverse drug events. CONCLUSIONS: Phenotyping algorithms developed for rare and complex conditions are likely to require adaptive implementation at multiple institutions. Better approaches are also needed to share algorithms. Early agreement on goals, data sources, and validation methods may improve the portability of the algorithms.},

DESIGN: Method development for case ascertainment. SETTING: Three UK population-based electronic health record databases: the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), the UK Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) database and the UK Office of National Statistics (ONS) mortality database. PARTICIPANTS: 16 040 people over the age of 18 years with linked CPRD-HES records indicating potential cholestatic liver injury between 1 January 2000 and 1 January 2013. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) The number of cases of cholestatic liver injury detected by the multidatabase algorithm. (2) The relative contribution of each data source to multidatabase case status. (3) The ability of the new single-database algorithm to discriminate multidatabase algorithm case status. RESULTS: Within the multidatabase case identification algorithm, 4033 of 16 040 potential cases (25%) were identified as definite cases based on CPRD data. HES data allowed possible cases to be discriminated from unlikely cases (947 of 16 040, 6%), but only facilitated identification of 1 definite case. ONS data did not contribute to case definition. The new single-database (CPRD-only) algorithm had a very good ability to discriminate multidatabase case status (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve 0.95). CONCLUSIONS: CPRD-HES-ONS linkage confers minimal improvement in cholestatic liver injury case ascertainment compared to using CPRD data alone, and a multidatabase algorithm provides little additional information for validation of a CPRD-only algorithm. The availability of laboratory test results within CPRD but not HES means that algorithms based on CPRD-HES-linked data may not always be merited for studies of liver injury, or for other outcomes relying primarily on laboratory test results.},

METHODS: In search 1, electronic medical records from patients seen between 1994 and 2004 with an ICD-9-CM code of acute liver injury were identified and cross-searched for the specific drug names in the dictation text. In search 2, all patients with an ICD-9-CM code of drug poisoning/overdose due to one of the four study drugs were identified. In search 3, patients with a poisoning code as well as an acute liver injury code were identified. RESULTS: Review of the records from the 7,395 search 1 patients yielded 51 DILI cases (0.7%). In contrast, the 566 search 2 patients yielded only three DILI cases (0.5%). Finally, search 3 provided the greatest specificity but a low rate of detection with only two patients (3.9%) having DILI due to one of the four drugs. CONCLUSION: Acute liver injury ICD-9-CM codes combined with a text search of the dictated medical record yielded the greatest number of DILI cases but was less specific than crossing acute liver injury and poisoning codes. Use of ICD-9-CM codes to identify rare adverse events like DILI remains problematic and highlights the need for prospective surveillance networks.},

  abstract = {We conducted a cohort study of acute, noninfectious liver injury among oral antimicrobial users. Potential cases were identified in the HealthCore Integrated Research Database (HIRD(SM)) population between July 1, 2001, and March 31, 2009, using ICD-9-CM codes primarily for acute and subacute necrosis of the liver, hepatic coma, and unspecified hepatitis. Liver test results were used to confirm case status according to published criteria. Two physician reviewers experienced in studying acute liver injury (blinded to study drug exposures) evaluated data abstracted from hospital and emergency department records to validate potential cases. Of 715 potential cases having claims associated with any of the primary screening codes, 312 (44%) were valid cases, 108 (15%) were not cases, and 295 (41%) were of uncertain status (records inadequate for validation). Among potential cases with adequate medical records, the PPV for presence of any of the primary codes was 74% (95% CI, 70%-78%). The highest PPV for a single code was for acute and subacute necrosis of the liver (84%; 95% CI, 77%-90%). Evaluation of cases of noninfectious liver injury using hospital and emergency department medical records continues to represent the preferred approach in studies using insurance claims data.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The development and validation of algorithms to identify cases of idiopathic acute liver injury (ALI) are essential to facilitate epidemiologic studies on drug-induced liver injury. The aim of this study is to determine the ability of diagnostic codes and laboratory measurements to identify idiopathic ALI cases. METHODS: In this cross-sectional validation study, patients were selected from the hospital-based Utrecht Patient Oriented Database between 2008 and 2010. Patients were identified using (I) algorithms based on ICD-9-CM codes indicative of idiopathic ALI combined with sets of liver enzyme values (ALT > 2x upper limit of normal (ULN); AST > 1ULN + AP > 1ULN + bilirubin > 1ULN; ALT > 3ULN; ALT > 3ULN + bilirubin > 2ULN; ALT > 10ULN) and (II) algorithms based on solely liver enzyme values (ALT > 3ULN + bilirubin > 2ULN; ALT > 10ULN). Hospital medical records were reviewed to confirm final diagnosis. The positive predictive value (PPV) of each algorithm was calculated. RESULTS: A total of 707 cases of ALI were identified. After medical review 194 (27%) patients had confirmed idiopathic ALI. The PPV for (I) algorithms with an ICD-9-CM code as well as abnormal tests ranged from 32% (13/41) to 48% (43/90) with the highest PPV found with ALT > 2ULN. The PPV for (II) algorithms with liver test abnormalities was maximally 26% (150/571). CONCLUSIONS: The algorithm based on ICD-9-CM codes indicative of ALI combined with abnormal liver-related laboratory tests is the most efficient algorithm for identifying idiopathic ALI cases. However, cases were missed using this algorithm, because not all ALI cases had been assigned the relevant diagnostic codes in daily practice.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Identification of acute liver failure (ALF) is important for post-marketing surveillance of medications, but the validity of using ICD-9 diagnoses and laboratory data to identify these events within electronic health records is unknown. We examined positive predictive values (PPVs) of hospital ICD-9 diagnoses and laboratory tests of liver dysfunction for identifying ALF within a large, community-based integrated care organization. METHODS: We identified Kaiser Permanente Northern California health plan members (2004-2010) with a hospital diagnosis suggesting ALF (ICD-9 570, 572.2, 572.4, 572.8, 573.3, 573.8, or V42.7) plus an inpatient international normalized ratio >/=1.5 (off warfarin) and total bilirubin >/=5.0 mg/dL. Hospital records were reviewed by hepatologists to adjudicate ALF events. PPVs for confirmed outcomes were determined for individual ICD-9 diagnoses, diagnoses plus prescriptions for hepatic encephalopathy treatment, and combinations of diagnoses in the setting of coagulopathy and hyperbilirubinemia. RESULTS: Among 669 members with no pre-existing liver disease, chart review confirmed ALF in 62 (9%). Despite the presence of co-existing coagulopathy and hyperbilirubinemia, individual ICD-9 diagnoses had low PPVs (range, 5-15%); requiring prescriptions for encephalopathy treatment did not increase PPVs of these diagnoses (range, 2-23%). Hospital diagnoses of other liver disorders (ICD-9 573.8) plus hepatic coma (ICD-9 572.2) had high PPV (67%; 95%CI, 9-99%) but only identified two (3%) ALF events. CONCLUSIONS: Algorithms comprising relevant hospital diagnoses, laboratory evidence of liver dysfunction, and prescriptions for hepatic encephalopathy treatment had low PPVs for confirmed ALF events. Studies of ALF will need to rely on medical records to confirm this outcome.},

We examined the positive predictive values (PPVs) of hospital ICD-9-CM diagnoses in identifying SALI among health plan members in the Mini-Sentinel Distributed Database (MSDD) for patients without liver/biliary disease and for those with chronic liver disease (CLD). METHODS: We selected random samples of members (149 without liver/biliary disease; 75 with CLD) with a principal hospital diagnosis suggestive of SALI (ICD-9-CM 570, 572.2, 572.4, 572.8, 573.3, 573.8, or V42.7) in the MSDD (2009-2010). Medical records were reviewed by hepatologists to confirm SALI events. PPVs of codes and code combinations for confirmed SALI were determined by CLD status. RESULTS: Among 105 members with available records and no liver/biliary disease, SALI was confirmed in 26 (PPV, 24.7%; 95%CI, 16.9-34.1%). Combined hospital diagnoses of acute hepatic necrosis (570) and liver disease sequelae (572.8) had high PPV (100%; 95%CI, 59.0-100%) and identified 7/26 (26.9%) events. Among 46 CLD members with available records, SALI was confirmed in 19 (PPV, 41.3%; 95%CI, 27.0-56.8%). Acute hepatic necrosis (570) or hepatorenal syndrome (572.4) plus any other SALI code had a PPV of 83.3% (95%CI, 51.6-97.9%) and identified 10/19 (52.6%) events. CONCLUSIONS: Most individual hospital ICD-9-CM diagnoses had low PPV for confirmed SALI events. Select code combinations had high PPV but did not capture all events.},

METHODS: Adults with serum potassium lab data (2010 to 2014) and >/=1 calendar year of data were included from a large US commercial claims database. Hyperkalemia was defined as >/=2 serum potassium measurements >5.0 mEq/L or one hyperkalemia diagnosis code (ICD-9-CM, 276.7) or one sodium polystyrene sulfonate fill. Hyperkalemia prevalence was estimated for the overall population and subgroups with hyperkalemia-related comorbidities by calendar year. Hyperkalemia prevalence was also standardized to the US population to estimate the number of US adults with hyperkalemia. RESULTS: The analysis included 2,270,635 patients (2010-2014). The annual prevalence of hyperkalemia in the overall population was 1.57% in 2014, with higher rates observed in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), heart failure, diabetes and hypertension. Among patients with CKD and/or heart failure, the 2014 annual prevalence was 6.35%. Among patients with hyperkalemia, 48.43% had CKD and/or heart failure in 2014. The prevalence of hyperkalemia was higher in patients with more severe CKD, as well as older patients and men. Extrapolating those results to the US population supports that 1.55% or 3.7 million US adults had hyperkalemia in 2014. CONCLUSIONS: An estimated 3.7 million US adults had hyperkalemia in 2014, and this prevalence rate has increased since 2010. In patients with CKD and/or heart failure, the annual prevalence of hyperkalemia was 6.35% in 2014, and about half of all patients with hyperkalemia have either CKD and/or heart failure.},

The aim of this study is to assess the hyperkalemia risk and combined use of spironolactone and long-term ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy for heart failure in a real-life setting of a heterogeneous population. METHODS: Using claims data of the statutory health insurance fund AOK, covering 30% of the German population, we performed a nested case-control study in a cohort of heart failure patients receiving continuous ACE/ARB therapy (n = 1,491,894). Hyperkalemia risk associated with concurrent use of spironolactone and ACE/ARB was calculated by conditional logistic regression in 1062 cases and 10,620 risk-set-sampling-matched controls. RESULTS: Risk of hyperkalemia in heart failure patients was significantly associated with spironolactone use (odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval (CI)) = 13.59 (11.63-15.88) in all and 11.05 (8.67-14.08) in those with information on New York Heart Association (NYHA) stage of disease). In the NYHA subpopulation, higher risk estimates were observed in short-term as compared with long-term users (OR (95%CI) = 13.00 (9.82-17.21) and 9.12 (6.78-12.26), respectively). Moreover, the association was stronger in older (>/=70 years of age) as compared with younger patients (<70 years of age) (OR (95%CI) = 12.32 (9.35-16.23) and 8.73 (5.05-15.08), respectively), although interaction was not significant (pinteraction = 0.07). CONCLUSIONS: Hyperkalemia risk associated with combined use of spironolactone and ACE/ARB is much stronger in real-life practice than observed in clinical trials. Careful potassium level monitoring in concomitant users of spironolactone and ACE/ARB is necessary.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hyperkalemia (serum potassium >5.0 mEq/L) may be caused by reduced kidney function and drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and is often present in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). OBJECTIVE: To quantify the burden of hyperkalemia in US Medicare fee-for-service and commercially insured populations using real-world claims data, focusing on prevalence, comorbidities, mortality, medical utilization, and cost. METHODS: A descriptive, retrospective claims data analysis was performed on patients with hyperkalemia using the 2014 Medicare 5% sample and the 2014 Truven Health Analytics MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounter databases. The starting study samples required patient insurance eligibility during >/=1 months in 2014. The identification of hyperkalemia and other comorbidities required having >/=1 qualifying claims in 2014 with an appropriate International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis code in any position. To address the differences between patients with and without hyperkalemia, CKD subsamples were analyzed separately. Mortality rates were calculated in the Medicare sample population only. The claims were grouped into major service categories; the allowed costs reflected all costs incurred by each cohort divided by the total number of member months for that cohort. RESULTS: The prevalence of hyperkalemia in the Medicare and commercially insured samples was 2.3% and 0.09%, respectively. Hyperkalemia was associated with multiple comorbidities, most notably CKD. The prevalence of CKD in the Medicare and the commercially insured members with hyperkalemia was 64.8% and 31.8%, respectively. After adjusting for CKD severity, the annual mortality rate for Medicare patients with CKD and hyperkalemia was 24.9% versus 10.4% in patients with CKD without hyperkalemia. The allowed costs in patients with CKD and hyperkalemia in the Medicare and commercially insured cohorts were more than twice those in patients with CKD without hyperkalemia. Inpatient care accounted for >50% of costs in patients with CKD and hyperkalemia. CONCLUSION: Hyperkalemia is associated with substantial clinical and economic burden among US commercially insured and Medicare populations.},

We examined mortality in relation to serum potassium in hypertensive patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: From Danish National Registries, we identified 44 799 hypertensive patients, aged 30 years or older, who had a serum potassium measurement within 90 days from diagnosis between 1995 and 2012. All-cause mortality was analysed according to seven predefined potassium levels: <3.5 (hypokalaemia), 3.5-3.7, 3.8-4.0, 4.1-4.4, 4.5-4.7, 4.8-5.0, and >5.0 mmol/L (hyperkalaemia). Outcome was 90-day mortality, estimated with multivariable Cox proportional hazard model, with the potassium interval of 4.1-4.4 mmol/L as reference. During 90-day follow-up, mortalities in the seven strata were 4.5, 2.7, 1.8, 1.5, 1.7, 2.7, and 3.6%, respectively. Adjusted risk for death was statistically significant for patients with hypokalaemia [hazard ratio (HR): 2.80, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 2.17-3.62], and hyperkalaemia (HR: 1.70, 95% CI: 1.36-2.13). Notably, normal potassium levels were also associated with increased mortality: K: 3.5-3.7 mmol/L (HR: 1.70, 95% CI: 1.36-2.13), K: 3.8-4.0 mmol/L (HR: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.00-1.47), and K: 4.8-5.0 mmol/L (HR: 1.48, 95% CI: 1.15-1.92). Thus, mortality in relation to the seven potassium ranges was U-shaped, with the lowest mortality in the interval of 4.1-4.4 mmol/L. CONCLUSION: Potassium levels outside the interval of 4.1-4.7 mmol/L were associated with increased mortality risk in patients with hypertension.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Administrative claims are a rich source of information for epidemiological and health services research; however, the ability to accurately capture specific diseases or complications using claims data has been debated. In this study, the authors examined the validity of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis codes for the identification of hyponatremia in an outpatient managed care population. METHODS: We analyzed outpatient laboratory and professional claims for patients aged 18 years and older in the National Managed Care Benchmark Database from Integrated Healthcare Information Services. We obtained all claims for outpatient serum sodium laboratory tests performed in 2004 and 2005, and all outpatient professional claims with a primary or secondary ICD-9-CM diagnosis code of hyponatremia (276.1). RESULTS: A total of 40,668 outpatient serum sodium laboratory results were identified as hyponatremic (serum sodium < 136 mmol/L). The sensitivity of ICD-9-CM codes for hyponatremia in outpatient professional claims within 15 days before or after the laboratory date was 3.5%. Even for severe cases (serum sodium < or = 125 mmol/L), sensitivity was < 30%. Specificity was > 99% for all cutoff points. CONCLUSION: ICD-9-CM codes in administrative data are insufficient to identify hyponatremia in an outpatient population.},

  abstract = {Medical diagnosis can be studied using various sources of information, such as medical and hospital discharge records and laboratory measurements. These sources do not always concur. The objective of the present study was to assess the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of hospital discharge diagnosis compared with clinical laboratory data for the identification of hyponatremia. Patients with hyponatremia were selected from a hospital information system determined by the International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition (ICD-9). The validity parameters for hyponatremia (ICD code 276.1) were estimated by comparison with accurate serum sodium (Na+) levels. A total of 2632 cases of hyponatremia were identified using laboratory measurements (Na+ < or =135 mmol/L). The sensitivity of ICD coding for hyponatremia was maximally about 30% for patients with very severe hyponatremia (Na+ < or =115 mmol/L). Corresponding specificities were high (>99%). In 87% of the cases with severe hyponatremia (Na+ < or =125 mmol/L), other discharge ICD codes reflecting severe morbidity were found. This study suggests that ICD codes for hyponatremia represent only one third of the patients admitted to the hospital and experiencing hyponatremia. About two thirds of the patients with hyponatremia were classified as hospitalized for other reasons. To assess the validity of case finding of patients with hyponatremia, the use of analytical techniques, such as certain laboratory measurements, is advisable.},

Our objectives were to determine the prevalence of hypomagnesemia and its association with PPIs in the community setting. We performed a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of a large health maintenance organization administrative database, including ambulatory patients with >/=1 serum magnesium concentrations between 2008 and 2011, the lowest referred to as "index magnesium." In cases with any (index magnesium </=0.7 mmol/L) or severe (</=0.55 mmol/L) hypomagnesemia, we analyzed (vs. controls, >0.7 mmol/L) the association with PPI or H2 -blocker use during the 4-12 months preceding the index magnesium by logistic regression analysis, adjusting for confounders. Among 95,205 subjects, 5,696 (6.0%) had any hypomagnesemia, which was severe in 454 (0.5%), with twofold higher prevalences in those with established risk factors. PPI use during the 4 months preceding the index magnesium was more common in cases of any hypomagnesemia (adjusted OR = 1.66; 95% CI, 1.55-1.78) and severe hypomagnesemia (adjusted OR = 3.79; 2.99-4.82) than in controls without acid suppression. Hypomagnesemia remained significantly associated with PPI use when using H2 -blocker-users as reference (adjusted OR = 1.25 [P = 0.003] and 2.65 [P < 0.001] for any and severe hypomagnesemia, respectively). We conclude that hypomagnesemia is associated with PPI use in ambulatory patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Case series suggest that long-term use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) is associated with hypomagnesemia, but the current literature lacks systematically collected data. Our aim was to examine whether hypomagnesemia at the time of hospital admission is associated with out-of-hospital use of PPIs. STUDY DESIGN: Nested case-control study matched for age and sex. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Data were collected retrospectively from a tertiary acute-care facility. Eligible cases consisted of 402 adults with hypomagnesemia (serum magnesium <1.4 mEq/L) at the time of hospital admission to medical services, age- and sex-matched with 402 control individuals with normal serum magnesium levels (1.4-2.0 mEq/L). PREDICTOR: Out-of-hospital PPI use was identified in the hospital record. An omeprazole equivalent dose was calculated when possible. Covariates included the Charlson-Deyo comorbidity index, diabetes, diuretic use, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and gastroesophageal reflux. OUTCOME: Multivariable conditional logistic regression analyses were used to examine the association of PPI use with hypomagnesemia at the time of hospital admission. RESULTS: PPI use was not associated with hypomagnesemia (adjusted OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.61-1.11). Neither PPI type nor omeprazole equivalent daily dose was associated with hypomagnesemia. Sensitivity analyses of PPI use restricted to patients with esophageal disorders (adjusted OR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.69-1.45), severe hypomagnesemia (magnesium, </=1.0 mEq/L; adjusted OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.13-4.61), or estimated glomerular filtration rate >/=60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (adjusted OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.53-1.34) were unrevealing. LIMITATIONS: Exposure misclassification; hospitalized patients on medical services may not be representative of a broader ambulatory-based population. CONCLUSIONS: In a hospital-based adult population, out-of-hospital PPI use is not associated with hypomagnesemia at the time of hospital admission to medical services. In light of these inconclusive results, prospective cohort studies are needed to address this rare potential medication-related adverse effect.},

  abstract = {Background: Treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) with nonselective alpha1 antagonists such as terazosin, doxazosin, and prazosin results in blood pressure reduction due to vasodilation. Objective: Using claims data from a large Medigap plan, we examined the effect of initiating nonselective alpha1-antagonist therapy on the incidence of hypotension-related adverse events likely to be associated with vascular alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonism in patients with BPH. Methods: Medical and prescription claims data were obtained from the MEDSTAT Group for 53,824 men with a diagnosis code for BPH during the study period (January 1995–December 1997). We examined the rate of possible hypotension-related adverse events (diagnosis codes for hypotension, syncope, dizziness, fractures, and other injuries) per 10,000 person-days for men who began therapy with alpha1 antagonists and for a random sample of nonusers, stratified by prior use of other antihypertensive agents. Results: After adjusting for baseline differences in event rates, those who initiated alpha1-antagonist therapy (n = 1564) had a significantly greater increase in hypotension-related adverse-event rates in the 4 months after initiation (vs the 4 months before initiation) than randomly selected nonusers (n = 8641) (increase of 1.82 vs decrease of 0.02 events per 10,000 person-days among those not taking antihypertensive agents; increase of 0.94 vs 0.69 events per 10,000 person-days among those taking other antihypertensive agents; P < 0.01). This increase began earlier and lasted longer among patients taking other antihypertensive agents. Those who discontinued their alpha1 antagonist had a higher rate of hypotensive events at baseline than those who did not (5.09 vs 3.19 events per 10,000 person-days among those using other antihypertensive agents; 3.62 vs 2.27 events per 10,000 person-days among those not using other antihypertensive agents; P < 0.05). Conclusions: Initiation of nonselective alpha1-antagonist therapy for the treatment of BPH increases the risk of a cluster of clinical events consistent with vascular alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonism. This effect is seen during a 4-month period around the initiation date. Prior initiation of other antihypertensive medication increases this effect. Urologists should consult with a patient's primary care physician about use of other antihypertensive agents before initiating nonselective alpha1-antagonist therapy for BPH.},

This study examined rates of screening, diagnosis, and treatment of BPH/LUTS among men seeking care for ED. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a retrospective US claims data analysis (1999-2004) evaluating men > or = 40 years old with a new diagnosis of or prescription medication for ED. Multivariate analyses were used to examine times to screening, diagnosis, and treatment. RESULTS: 81 659 men with ED were identified (mean age 57 years). The baseline prevalence of recorded BPH was 1.5%. During the follow-up period (mean 2.2 years), 7.6% had documented BPH. Time to screening was shorter among patients seeing urologists (121.1 days) compared with those seeing primary-care physicians (282.2 days). Controlling for demographic and clinical characteristics, patients who saw a urologist were more likely to be screened (OR: 2.4, p < 0.0001), diagnosed with BPH (OR: 1.8, p < 0.0001), and treated (OR: 1.3, p < 0.0001), relative to patients seeing other providers. Men aged 75 and over were 43% less likely to be screened (p < 0.0001), but 5.4 times more likely to be diagnosed with BPH (p < 0.0001) and 5.3 times more likely to be treated (p < 0.0001) compared with men aged 40-49. CONCLUSIONS: Screening for BPH appears less likely for men with ED who do not see a urologist. When screening does occur, it takes much longer with non-specialty providers. Patient age and provider specialty are key factors associated with screening, diagnosis, and treatment of BPH among men with ED.},

The study objective was to test the hypothesis that IMRT, compared with CRT, is associated with a reduction in bowel, urinary, and erectile complications in elderly men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We undertook an observational cohort study using registry and administrative claims data from the SEER-Medicare database. We identified men aged 65 years or older diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer in the United States between 2002 and 2004 who received IMRT (n = 5,845) or CRT (n = 6,753). The primary outcome was a composite measure of bowel complications. Secondary outcomes were composite measures of urinary and erectile complications. We also examined specific subsets of bowel (proctitis/hemorrhage) and urinary (cystitis/hematuria) events within the composite complication measures. RESULTS: IMRT was associated with reductions in composite bowel complications (24-month cumulative incidence 18.8% vs. 22.5%; hazard ratio [HR] 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79-0.93) and proctitis/hemorrhage (HR 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64-0.95). IMRT was not associated with rates of composite urinary complications (HR 0.93; 95% CI, 0.83-1.04) or cystitis/hematuria (HR 0.94; 95% CI, 0.83-1.07). The incidence of erectile complications involving invasive procedures was low and did not differ significantly between groups, although IMRT was associated with an increase in new diagnoses of impotence (HR 1.27, 95% CI, 1.14-1.42). CONCLUSION: IMRT is associated with a small reduction in composite bowel complications and proctitis/hemorrhage compared with CRT in elderly men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer.},

We used real-world observational data to assess: 1) the prevalence of ED diagnosis or treatment by age subgroups; and 2) the relationship of age with ED diagnosis or treatment after controlling for ED-related comorbidities in the USA. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used de-identified claims data (MarketScan((R)) databases; primary analysis). Sensitivity analysis was conducted using electronic health records (Humedica((R)) database). Inclusion criteria were men aged >/=18 years with a 360-day continuous enrollment before the index date. We assessed the prevalence of ED diagnosis or phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (PDE5I) prescription by age and the risk for ED diagnosis or treatment by age after controlling for comorbidities (hypertension, other cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, depression and benign prostatic hyperplasia). RESULTS: Of 19,833,939 men meeting inclusion criteria in the primary analysis, only 1 108 842 (5.6%) had an ED diagnosis or PDE5I prescription (mean [SD] age: 55.2 [11.2] years). Prevalence of ED diagnosis or treatment increased from age 18-29 years (0.4%) to 60-69 years (11.5%), then decreased in the seventh (11.0%), eighth (4.6%), and ninth (0.9%) decades. Men with ED diagnosis or treatment had a higher prevalence of any comorbidity (63.1% vs 29.3% for men without ED) and of each comorbid condition. In multivariate analyses, age was an independent risk factor for ED diagnosis or treatment. Sensitivity analysis provided consistent results. CONCLUSIONS: In a real-world setting in the USA, the prevalence of ED diagnosis or PDE5I treatment is generally low, increases with age, decreases in very old men, and is associated with increased prevalence of comorbidities. Age is an independent risk factor for ED diagnosis or treatment after controlling for comorbidities.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Prior research conducted on treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED) has been derived from surveys involving relatively small populations of men. There are needs for large population-based studies in this area. Our study addresses that need. AIM: The aim of this study was to characterize ED treatment among a large population of men. METHODS: Patients >/=30 years in commercial insurance dataset with diagnosis code for ED during 12-month period ending June 2011 were identified. Men were considered "treated" if prescription was filled for phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (PDE5i), injection or urethral prostaglandins, or androgen replacement (ART) during study period. "Untreated" patients received the diagnosis but did not fill prescription. Statistical analyses were used to compare prescription frequency with clinical characteristics, including age and comorbidities. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: ED treatment rates among large population of insured men, treatment types employed, patient demographics, associated medical comorbidities of this population, and prescriber details were the main outcome measures. RESULTS: Only 25.4% of 6,228,509 men with ED were treated during study period. While PDE5is were the most commonly prescribed medical therapy (75.2%), ART was utilized as monotherapy or in combination therapy in 30.6% of men. ART was significantly (P < 0.0001) more frequently used in men <40 and >65 years. Although ED frequency was associated with increased age and number of comorbidities, men >60 years were significantly (P < 0.0001) less likely to be treated compared with men aged 40-59 years. Additionally, treatment frequency did not vary as a function of number of comorbidities. However, compared with men with prostate cancer, men with comorbid hypogonadism, sleep disorders, benign prostatic hyperplasia, or components of metabolic syndrome were (P < 0.0001) more likely to be treated. CONCLUSIONS: Despite high prevalence of ED with age and comorbidities, most men continue receiving no treatment. Although benefits of medical intervention for ED are well-recognized, many barriers to treatment continually exist including physician, patient and partner preference and knowledge.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To define the accuracy of administrative datasets to identify primary diagnoses of breast cancer based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 9th or 10th revision codes. DESIGN: Systematic review. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library (April 2017). ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: The inclusion criteria were: (a) the presence of a reference standard; (b) the presence of at least one accuracy test measure (eg, sensitivity) and (c) the use of an administrative database. DATA EXTRACTION: Eligible studies were selected and data extracted independently by two reviewers; quality was assessed using the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic accuracy criteria. DATA ANALYSIS: Extracted data were synthesised using a narrative approach. RESULTS: From 2929 records screened 21 studies were included (data collection period between 1977 and 2011). Eighteen studies evaluated ICD-9 codes (11 of which assessed both invasive breast cancer (code 174.x) and carcinoma in situ (ICD-9 233.0)); three studies evaluated invasive breast cancer-related ICD-10 codes. All studies except one considered incident cases.The initial algorithm results were: sensitivity >/=80% in 11 of 17 studies (range 57%-99%); positive predictive value was >/=83% in 14 of 19 studies (range 15%-98%) and specificity >/=98% in 8 studies. The combination of the breast cancer diagnosis with surgical procedures, chemoradiation or radiation therapy, outpatient data or physician claim may enhance the accuracy of the algorithms in some but not all circumstances. Accuracy for breast cancer based on outpatient or physician's data only or breast cancer diagnosis in secondary position diagnosis resulted low. CONCLUSION: Based on the retrieved evidence, administrative databases can be employed to identify primary breast cancer. The best algorithm suggested is ICD-9 or ICD-10 codes located in primary position. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42015026881.},

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: The algorithm training and validation sets were based on data from 2000 and 2001, respectively. The validation was carried out at an individual level by linkage of cases identified by the algorithm with cases in the Piedmont Cancer Registry diagnosed in 2001. RESULTS: The sensitivity of the algorithm was higher for lung cancer (80.8%) than for breast (76.7%) and colorectal (72.4%) cancers. The positive predictive values were 78.7%, 87.9%, and 92.6% for lung, colorectal, and breast cancer, respectively. The high values for colorectal and breast cancers were due to the model's ability to distinguish prevalent from incident cases and to the accuracy of surgery claims for case identification. CONCLUSIONS: Given its moderate sensitivity, this algorithm is not intended to replace cancer registration, but it is a valuable tool to investigate other aspects of cancer surveillance. This method provides a valid study base for timely monitoring cancer practice and related outcomes, geographic and temporal variations, and costs.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Population-level health administrative datasets such as hospital discharge data are used increasingly to evaluate health services and outcomes of care. However information about the accuracy of Australian discharge data in identifying cancer, associated procedures and comorbidity is limited. The Admitted Patients Data Collection (APDC) is a census of inpatient hospital discharges in the state of New South Wales (NSW). Our aim was to assess the accuracy of the APDC in identifying upper gastro-intestinal (upper GI) cancer cases, procedures for associated curative resection and comorbidities at the time of admission compared to data abstracted from medical records (the 'gold standard'). METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 240 patients with an incident upper GI cancer diagnosis derived from a clinical database in one NSW area health service from July 2006 to June 2007. Extracted case record data was matched to APDC discharge data to determine sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV) and agreement between the two data sources (kappa-coefficient). RESULTS: The accuracy of the APDC diagnostic codes in identifying site-specific incident cancer ranged from 80-95% sensitivity. This was comparable to the accuracy of APDC procedure codes in identifying curative resection for upper GI cancer. PPV ranged from 42-80% for cancer diagnosis and 56-93% for curative surgery. Agreement between the data sources was >0.72 for most cancer diagnoses and curative resections. However, APDC discharge data was less accurate in reporting common comorbidities - for each condition, sensitivity ranged from 9-70%, whilst agreement ranged from kappa = 0.64 for diabetes down to kappa < 0.01 for gastro-oesophageal reflux disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Identifying incident cases of upper GI cancer and curative resection from hospital administrative data is satisfactory but under-ascertained. Linkage of multiple population-health datasets is advisable to maximise case ascertainment and minimise false-positives. Consideration must be given when utilising hospital discharge data alone for generating comorbidity indices, as disease burden at the time of admission is under-reported.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop algorithms to identify metastatic cancer in claims data, using tumor stage from an oncology electronic medical record (EMR) data warehouse as the gold standard. METHODS: Data from an outpatient oncology EMR database were linked to medical and pharmacy claims data. Patients diagnosed with breast, lung, colorectal, or prostate cancer with a stage recorded in the EMR between 2004 and 2010 and with medical claims available were eligible for the study. Separate algorithms were developed for each tumor type using variables from the claims, including diagnoses, procedures, drugs, and oncologist visits. Candidate variables were reviewed by two oncologists. For each tumor type, the selected variables were entered into a classification and regression tree model to determine the algorithm with the best combination of positive predictive value (PPV), sensitivity, and specificity. RESULTS: A total of 1385 breast cancer, 1036 lung, 727 colorectal, and 267 prostate cancer patients qualified for the analysis. The algorithms varied by tumor type but typically included International Classification of Diseases-Ninth Revision codes for secondary neoplasms and use of chemotherapy and other agents typically given for metastatic disease. The final models had PPV ranging from 0.75 to 0.86, specificity 0.75-0.97, and sensitivity 0.60-0.81. CONCLUSIONS: While most of these algorithms for metastatic cancer had good specificity and acceptable PPV, a tradeoff with sensitivity prevented any model from having good predictive ability on all measures. Results suggest that accurate ascertainment of metastatic status may require access to medical records or other confirmatory data sources.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Data from centralised, population-based statutory cancer registries are generally considered the 'gold standard' for confirming incident cases of cancer. When these are not available, or more current information is needed, hospital or other routinely collected population-level data may be feasible alternative sources. We aimed to determine the validity of various methods using routinely collected administrative health data for ascertaining incident cases of colorectal or lung cancer in participants from the 45 and Up Study in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. METHODS: For 266,844 participants in the 45 and Up Study (recruited 2006-2009) ascertainment of incident colorectal or lung cancers was assessed using diagnosis and treatment records in linked administrative health datasets (hospital, emergency department, Medicare and pharmaceutical claims, death records). This was compared with ascertainment via the NSW Cancer Registry (NSWCR, the 'gold standard') for a period for which both data sources were available for participants. RESULTS: A total of 2253 colorectal and 1019 lung cancers were recorded for study participants in the NSWCR over the period 2006-2010. A diagnosis of primary cancer recorded in the statewide Admitted Patient Data Collection identified the majority of NSWCR colorectal and lung cancers, with sensitivities and positive predictive values (PPV) of 95% and 91% for colorectal cancer and 81% and 85% for lung cancer, respectively. Using additional information on lung cancer deaths from death records increased sensitivity to 84% (PPV 83%) for lung cancer, but did not improve ascertainment of colorectal cancers. Hospital procedure codes for colorectal cancer surgery identified cases with sensitivity 81% and PPV 54%. No other individual indicator had sensitivity >50% or PPV >65% for either cancer type and no combination of indicators increased both the sensitivity and PPV above that achieved using the hospital cancer diagnosis data. All specificities were close to 100%; 95% confidence intervals for sensitivity and PPV were generally +/-2%. CONCLUSIONS: In NSW, identifying new cases of colorectal and lung cancer from administrative health datasets, such as hospital records, is a feasible alternative when cancer registry data are not available. However, the strengths and limitations of the different data sources should be borne in mind.},

METHODS: ACI per 100,000 insured persons for breast, prostate and colorectal cancer were estimated using BARMER Statutory Health Insurance claims data. Incident cancer cases were defined as having an in- or outpatient diagnosis in 2013, no diagnosis in a lookback period of 1 year and a second diagnosis (or death) in a confirmation period of 1 quarter. We varied lookback periods from 1 to 7 years, confirmation periods from 1 to 4 quarters as well as the definition of confirmatory events and compared ACI estimates to cancer registry data. RESULTS: ACI were higher for breast (138.7) and prostate (103.6) but lower for colorectal cancer (42.1) when compared to cancer registries (119.3, 98.0 and 45.5, respectively). Extending the lookback period to 7 years reduced ACI to 129.0, 95.1 and 38.3. An extended confirmation period of 4 quarters increased ACI to 151.3, 114.9 and 46.8. Including breast and colorectal surgeries as a confirmatory event reduced ACI to 114.9 and 37.1, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The choice of lookback and confirmation periods and the definition of confirmatory events have considerable impact on the number of incident cancer cases identified and ACI estimated. Researchers need to be aware of potential misclassification when identifying incident cancer cases in administrative data. Further validation studies as well as studies using administrative data to estimate cancer incidences should consider several choices of the lookback and confirmation periods and the definition of confirmatory events to show how these parameters impact the validity and robustness of their results.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM)-based algorithms to identify patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have not been developed outside of the Veterans Affairs healthcare setting. The development and validation of such algorithms are necessary for the conduct of population-based studies evaluating the epidemiology and comparative effectiveness and safety of therapies for HCC. METHODS: We queried electronic medical records at two tertiary care hospitals to identify patients with two ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes for a chronic liver disease and/or cirrhosis plus two ICD-9-CM codes for HCC. We determined the positive predictive value (PPV) of this algorithm by comparing it to diagnoses of HCC confirmed by expert medical record review. RESULTS: Among 101 patients meeting the algorithm, 88 (PPV: 87.1%; 95% CI: 79.0-93.0%) had confirmed HCC. The algorithm's sensitivity was 91.7% among patients with confirmed HCC, and its specificity was 98.7% among chronic liver disease patients without HCC. Excluding patients who received systemic chemotherapy in the 12 months prior to or 6 months after the initial ICD-9-CM code in the algorithm, the PPV increased to 91.6% (87/95; 95% CI: 84.1-96.3%). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of at least two ICD-9-CM codes for a chronic liver disease and/or cirrhosis plus two ICD-9-CM codes for HCC has a high PPV for identifying HCC cases. This simple, claims-based algorithm can be used in future epidemiologic studies to examine risk factors for HCC and evaluate outcomes and adverse events of medical therapies prescribed for HCC patients.},

This study aimed to assess the validity of ascertaining incident cases and resection use for pancreatic and periampullary cancers from linked administrative hospital data, compared with data from a cancer registry (the 'gold standard'). DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Analysis of linked statutory population-based cancer registry data and administrative hospital data for adults (aged >/=18 years) with a pancreatic or periampullary cancer case diagnosed during 2005-2009 or a hospital admission for these cancers between 2005 and 2013 in New South Wales, Australia. METHODS: The sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) of pancreatic and periampullary cancer case ascertainment from hospital admission data were calculated for the 2005-2009 period through comparison with registry data. We examined the effect of the look-back period to distinguish incident cancer cases from prevalent cancer cases from hospital admission data using 2009 and 2013 as index years. RESULTS: Sensitivity of case ascertainment from the hospital data was 87.5% (4322/4939), with higher sensitivity when the cancer was resected (97.9%, 715/730) and for pancreatic cancers (88.6%, 3733/4211). Sensitivity was lower in regional (83.3%) and remote (85.7%) areas, particularly in areas with interstate outflow of patients for treatment, and for cases notified to the registry by death certificate only (9.6%). The PPV for the identification of incident cases was 82.0% (4322/5272). A 2-year look-back period distinguished the majority (98%) of incident cases from prevalent cases in linked hospital data. CONCLUSIONS: Pancreatic and periampullary cancer cases and resection use can be ascertained from linked hospital admission data with sufficient validity for informing aspects of health service delivery and system-level monitoring. Limited tumour clinical information and variation in case ascertainment across population subgroups are limitations of hospital-derived cancer incidence data when compared with population cancer registries.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-grade cervical dysplasia or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse has been widely used as a surrogate endpoint in cervical cancer screening or prevention trials. METHODS: To identify high-grade cervical dysplasia and cervical cancer, we developed claims-based algorithms that incorporated a combination of diagnosis and procedure codes using the billing data in an electronic medical records database and assessed the validity of the algorithms in an independent administrative claims database. We calculated the positive predictive value (PPV) with the 95% confidence interval (CI) of each algorithm, using new cytologic or pathologic diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or 3, carcinoma in situ, or cervical cancer as the gold standard. RESULTS: Having >/=1 diagnosis code for high-grade cervical dysplasia or cervical cancer had a PPV of 57.1% (95%CI, 54.7-59.5%). By requiring >/=2 diagnoses for high-grade cervical dysplasia or cervical cancer, separated by 7-30 days, the PPV increased to 60.2% (95%CI, 53.9-66.1%). At least two diagnoses and a procedure code within a month from the first diagnosis date yielded a PPV of 80.7% (95%CI, 73.6-86.2%). The algorithms had greater PPVs in identifying prevalent high-grade cervical dysplasia or cervical cancer. Overall, the PPVs of these algorithms were similar or slightly lower in the external claims data than in the sample used to derive the algorithms. CONCLUSIONS: Use of >/=2 diagnosis codes in combination with a procedure code appears to be a valid tool for studying high-grade cervical dysplasia and cervical cancer in both electronic medical record and administrative claims databases.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To validate the recorded diagnoses of colorectal cancer (CRC) and identify false negatives in The Health Improvement Network (THIN) primary care database. METHODS: We conducted a validation study of incident CRC cases in THIN among patients aged 40-89 years from 2000-2011. CRC Read code entries (N = 3805) were verified by manual review of patients' electronic medical records (EMRs) including free-text comments. Incident CRC cases in THIN ascertained following manual review were validated against two data sources deemed gold standards: (i) questionnaires sent to primary care practitioners (PCPs; for a random sample of 100 potential CRC cases), and (ii) Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) among linked practices. False negatives in THIN were identified by searching for International Classification of Diseases-10 codes related to CRC in HES. RESULTS: Of 3805 CRC cases identified in THIN via Read codes, 3033 patients (80.0%) were considered definite cases after manual review of EMRs. The positive predictive value (PPV) of CRC Read codes was 86.0% after removing patients identified from THIN via a Read code for 'fast track referral for suspected CRC'. The response rate from PCPs was 87.0% (n = 87), and the PPV of CRC in THIN was 100% based on PCP questionnaires. Using HES, the PPV for CRC in THIN was 97.9% (556/568), and false negative rate was 6.1% (36/592). CONCLUSIONS: CRC diagnostic Read codes in THIN have a high PPV, which is increased further following manual review of free-text comments. The false negative rate of CRC diagnoses in THIN is low.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite the importance of estimating population level cancer outcomes, most registries do not collect critical events such as relapse. Attempts to use health administrative data to identify these events have focused on older adults and have been mostly unsuccessful. We developed and tested administrative data-based algorithms in a population-based cohort of adolescents and young adults with cancer. METHODS: We identified all Ontario adolescents and young adults 15-21 years old diagnosed with leukemia, lymphoma, sarcoma, or testicular cancer between 1992-2012. Chart abstraction determined the end of initial treatment (EOIT) date and subsequent cancer-related events (progression, relapse, second cancer). Linkage to population-based administrative databases identified fee and procedure codes indicating cancer treatment or palliative care. Algorithms determining EOIT based on a time interval free of treatment-associated codes, and new cancer-related events based on billing codes, were compared with chart-abstracted data. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 1404 patients. Time periods free of treatment-associated codes did not validly identify EOIT dates; using subsequent codes to identify new cancer events was thus associated with low sensitivity (56.2%). However, using administrative data codes that occurred after the EOIT date based on chart abstraction, the first cancer-related event was identified with excellent validity (sensitivity, 87.0%; specificity, 93.3%; positive predictive value, 81.5%; negative predictive value, 95.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Although administrative data alone did not validly identify cancer-related events, administrative data in combination with chart collected EOIT dates was associated with excellent validity. The collection of EOIT dates by cancer registries would significantly expand the potential of administrative data linkage to assess cancer outcomes.},

METHODS: The eligible cohort comprised 42,556 participants, registered with English general practices in the General Practice Research Database (GPRD) that consented to CR linkage. CR and primary care records were compared for cancer diagnosis, date of cancer diagnosis and death. Read and ICD cancer code sets were reviewed and agreed by two authors. RESULTS: There were 5216 (91% of CR total) cancer events diagnosed in both sources. There were 494 (9%) diagnosed in CR only and 213 (4%) that were diagnosed in GPRD only. The predictive value of a GPRD cancer diagnosis was 96% for lung cancer, 92% for urinary tract cancer, 96% for gastro-oesophageal cancer and 98% for colorectal cancer. 'False negative' primary care records were sometimes accounted for by registration end dates being shortly before cancer diagnosis dates. The date of cancer diagnosis was median 11 (interquartile range -6 to 30) days later in GPRD compared with CR. Death records were consistent for the two sources for 3337/3397 (99%) of cases. CONCLUSION: Recording of cancer diagnosis and mortality in primary care electronic records is generally consistent with CR in England. Linkage studies must pay careful attention to selection of codes to define eligibility and timing of diagnoses in relation to beginning and end of record.},

This study quantifies and compares adverse event (AE) crude rates and costs associated with ITP treatments as found in claims data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective claims-based analysis was conducted using IMS Pharmetrics Plus database. Included patients were >/=18 years old, with a diagnosis of ITP (2007-2012); an ITP-related claim for anti-D, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), rituximab, romiplostim, or eltrombopag; and 1-year continuous enrollment (3-years for rituximab) during follow-up. AEs and event costs were identified during active treatment, defined from the first claim of each drug to a pre-defined treatment gap or end of study period. Descriptive statistics were reported with Wilcoxon rank-sum significance tests. RESULTS: A total of 2,518 patients were identified (mean age = 50.8 (+/-16.3 years); 55.8% male). Of all patients, 22.8% experienced any AE. Significantly fewer anti-D patients had any AE (13.8% vs IVIG: 21.1%, rituximab: 29.4%, romiplostim: 28.1%, eltrombopag: 22.4%). Nausea/vomiting and arthralgia/musculoskeletal pain were most common across treatments, and hemolytic events did not differ significantly across treatments. Most costly AEs were urinary tract infection, aseptic meningitis, and fever ($5000+/case); headache, nasal congestion, and hemolytic event were $4,000-5,000/case. Cost per AE did not differ by treatment. LIMITATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: Although lower than trial-based AE rates, claims for ITP treatment-related AEs are common, with higher numbers for rituximab and lower numbers for anti-D. This disparity suggests a possible differential cost burden overall that future analysis should explore.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Nausea and vomiting (NV) are common side effects of opioid use and limiting factors in pain management. This study sought to quantify the frequency of antiemetic prescribing and the impact of NV on health care resource utilization and costs in outpatients prescribed opioids for acute pain. The perspective was that of a commercial health plan. METHODS: Medical and pharmacy claims from IMS PharMetrics Plus were used to identify patients initiating opioid therapy with a prescription for an oxycodone-, hydrocodone- or codeine-containing immediate-release product for acute use (</=15-day supply) between October 1, 2013 and September 30, 2014. Patients with a medical claim for NV (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes 787.0x), with or without an antiemetic prescription fill, were compared with patients with no NV claim or antiemetic prescription fill to assess differences in all-cause health care utilization and costs over 1 month. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to adjust for between-group differences in baseline patient characteristics. RESULTS: The co-prescribing of opioids with antiemetic agents was 10.2%. After PSM (n = 45,790 per group), patients with NV claims had significantly more hospitalizations (11.5% vs 4.2%), emergency department visits (65.0% vs 12.1%), and physician office visits (85.2% vs 64.5%) compared with patients with no NV claims (all P < 0.0001). Mean total health care costs were higher among patients with a NV claim versus those without evidence of the side effect ($6290 vs $2309; P < 0.0001). Among patients with a recent hospitalization, patients with NV claims had higher rates of 30-day rehospitalization than those with no NV claims (24.4% vs 3.0%; P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Among outpatients prescribed opioids for management of acute pain, co-prescribing with antiemetics was low, and the economic burden associated with NV was high. Efforts to prevent NV in patients receiving opioid therapy may improve patient outcomes and provide cost savings to the health care system. FUNDING: Daiichi Sankyo, Inc.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Diagnosis codes have been valid tools to identify severe neutropenia leading to hospitalization in claims data, but no data exist on the accuracy of outpatient diagnosis of neutropenia. We examined the validity and accuracy of claims-based algorithms to identify neutropenia from outpatient visits. METHODS: Adults with outpatient diagnosis of neutropenia in the HealthCore Integrated Research Database were identified by several algorithms using a combination of International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9) codes and drug use data. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value of these algorithms using outpatient laboratory data within 3 months of the diagnosis as the gold standard to ascertain cases of mild (absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <1,500/muL) and severe (ANC <500/muL) neutropenia. RESULTS: Among 95,742 eligible subjects, 867 patients were identified with any ICD-9 codes for neutropenia. This algorithm had high specificity (99%), but low sensitivity (9%) and PPV (18%) for mild neutropenia. Among the subjects identified with the ICD-9 288.0 (N = 203), sensitivity was 4% and PPV was 33%. Specificity and PPV of the algorithm that combined any ICD-9 codes for neutropenia with dispensing of pegfilgrastim or filgrastim were 100 and 56% for mild neutropenia, respectively. Sensitivity was 1%. All algorithms had slightly higher sensitivity, but lower PPV for severe neutropenia. CONCLUSIONS: Use of ICD-9 codes for neutropenia in combination with drug use data did not appear to accurately identify outpatient diagnosis of neutropenia without using laboratory results, but it may be useful in determining the absence of neutropenia in claims data.},

The accuracy of methods previously used to identify FN in such databases has not been formally evaluated. METHODS: Data comprised linked electronic medical records from Geisinger Health System and healthcare claims data from Geisinger Health Plan. Subjects were classified into subgroups based on whether or not they were hospitalized for FN per the presumptive "gold standard" (ANC <1.0x10(9)/L, and body temperature >/=38.3 degrees C or receipt of antibiotics) and claims-based definition (diagnosis codes for neutropenia, fever, and/or infection). Accuracy was evaluated principally based on positive predictive value (PPV) and sensitivity. RESULTS: Among 357 study subjects, 82 (23%) met the gold standard for hospitalized FN. For the claims-based definition including diagnosis codes for neutropenia plus fever in any position (n=28), PPV was 100% and sensitivity was 34% (95% CI: 24-45). For the definition including neutropenia in the primary position (n=54), PPV was 87% (78-95) and sensitivity was 57% (46-68). For the definition including neutropenia in any position (n=71), PPV was 77% (68-87) and sensitivity was 67% (56-77). CONCLUSIONS: Patients hospitalized for chemotherapy-induced FN can be identified in healthcare claims databases--with an acceptable level of mis-classification--using diagnosis codes for neutropenia, or neutropenia plus fever.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The Food and Drug Administration's Mini-Sentinel pilot program aims to conduct active surveillance to refine safety signals that emerge for marketed medical products. A key facet of this surveillance is to develop and understand the validity of algorithms for identifying health outcomes of interest from administrative and claims data. This article summarizes the process and findings of the algorithm review of hypersensitivity reactions. METHODS: PubMed and Iowa Drug Information Service searches were conducted to identify citations applicable to the hypersensitivity reactions of health outcomes of interest. Level 1 abstract reviews and Level 2 full-text reviews were conducted to find articles using administrative and claims data to identify hypersensitivity reactions and including validation estimates of the coding algorithms. RESULTS: We identified five studies that provided validated hypersensitivity-reaction algorithms. Algorithm positive predictive values (PPVs) for various definitions of hypersensitivity reactions ranged from 3% to 95%. PPVs were high (i.e. 90%-95%) when both exposures and diagnoses were very specific. PPV generally decreased when the definition of hypersensitivity was expanded, except in one study that used data mining methodology for algorithm development. CONCLUSIONS: The ability of coding algorithms to identify hypersensitivity reactions varied, with decreasing performance occurring with expanded outcome definitions. This examination of hypersensitivity-reaction coding algorithms provides an example of surveillance bias resulting from outcome definitions that include mild cases. Data mining may provide tools for algorithm development for hypersensitivity and other health outcomes. Research needs to be conducted on designing validation studies to test hypersensitivity-reaction algorithms and estimating their predictive power, sensitivity, and specificity.},

We developed four algorithms on a training set of 31,211 patient records from a large tertiary hospital. We determined the performance of these algorithms against manually curated records. The best algorithm used a combination of elevated creatine kinase (>4x the upper limit of normal (ULN)), discharge summary, diagnosis, and absence of statin in discharge medications. This algorithm achieved a positive predictive value of 52-71% and a sensitivity of 72-78% on two validation sets of >30,000 records each. Using this algorithm, the incidence of SIM was estimated at 0.18%. This algorithm captured three times more rhabdomyolysis cases than spontaneous reports (95% vs. 30% of manually curated gold standard cases). Our results show the potential power of utilizing data and text mining of EMRs to enhance pharmacovigilance activities.},

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted a retrospective study among patients enrolled in 11 geographically dispersed managed care organizations. Cohorts of new users of specific statins and fibrates were identified by selecting patients with an initial dispensing of the drug during the period 1 January 1998 to 30 June 2001. Potential cases of serious myopathy or rhabdomyolysis were identified using specific criteria based upon ICD-9-CM codes suggesting a muscle disorder or acute renal failure. RESULTS: A total of 194 hospitalizations meeting the criteria for chart review selection were identified among 206,732 new users of statins and 15,485 new users of fibrates. Overall, 31 cases of serious, clinically important myopathy or rhabdomyolysis (18%) were confirmed through chart review. Of these, 26 (84%) had a claim including codes for myoglobinuria (ICD-9-CM 791.3) or other disorders of muscle, ligament, and fascia (ICD-9-CM 728.89). A PPV of 74% (26 of 35 patients meeting criteria) was found for a composite definition that included (1) a primary or secondary discharge code for myoglobinuria, (2) a primary code for "other disorders of muscle," or (3) a secondary code for "other disorders of muscle" accompanied by a claim for a CK test within 7 days of hospitalization or a discharge code for acute renal failure. CONCLUSION: For rare adverse events such as serious myopathy or rhabdomyolysis, large population-based databases that include diagnosis and laboratory test claims data can facilitate epidemiologic research.},

Patients with at least one medical claim with ICD-9 code 446.6X between 1/1/2001 and 5/31/2008 were identified in the HealthCore Integrated Research Database (HIRD). A chart abstraction form was developed to enable case determination for patients identified by the claims code. Two clinical experts, not involved in the design of the study, reviewed the abstracted medical record data and determined whether definite evidence supporting the diagnosis of TTP was present. The positive predictive value (PPV) of the claims coding algorithm for cases assessed by both reviewers was computed. The claims algorithm was further refined and the PPV of the refined algorithm was computed. One hundred eighty-nine abstracted charts were reviewed by two clinical experts; 86 were assessed to have definite evidence supporting the diagnosis of TTP (PPV 45.5% [86/189; 95% confidence interval (CI), 38.3-52.9%]). Refinement of the claims algorithm first included the use of plasma exchange treatment, resulting in 103 potential cases, of which 67 were assessed to have definite evidence supporting the diagnosis of TTP (PPV 65.0%; 95% CI, 55.0-74.2%). Further refinement of the claims algorithm ruled out alternative diagnoses that may mimic TTP; 34 were assessed to have definite evidence supporting the diagnosis of TTP (PPV 72.3% [34/47; 95% CI, 57.4-84.4%]).Our findings demonstrate the difficulty of confirming the diagnosis of rare disorders that lack definite diagnostic criteria, and indicate that more complex claims coding algorithms are necessary for identifying these disorders.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Health administrative data are frequently used for diabetes surveillance. We aimed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of a commonly-used diabetes case definition (two physician claims or one hospital discharge abstract record within a two-year period) and their potential effect on prevalence estimation. METHODS: Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we searched Medline (from 1950) and Embase (from 1980) databases for validation studies through August 2012 (keywords: "diabetes mellitus"; "administrative databases"; "validation studies"). Reviewers abstracted data with standardized forms and assessed quality using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) criteria. A generalized linear model approach to random-effects bivariate regression meta-analysis was used to pool sensitivity and specificity estimates. We applied correction factors derived from pooled sensitivity and specificity estimates to prevalence estimates from national surveillance reports and projected prevalence estimates over 10 years (to 2018). RESULTS: The search strategy identified 1423 abstracts among which 11 studies were deemed relevant and reviewed; 6 of these reported sensitivity and specificity allowing pooling in a meta-analysis. Compared to surveys or medical records, sensitivity was 82.3% (95%CI 75.8, 87.4) and specificity was 97.9% (95%CI 96.5, 98.8). The diabetes case definition underestimated prevalence when it was </=10.6% and overestimated prevalence otherwise. CONCLUSION: The diabetes case definition examined misses up to one fifth of diabetes cases and wrongly identifies diabetes in approximately 2% of the population. This may be sufficiently sensitive and specific for surveillance purposes, in particular monitoring prevalence trends. Applying correction factors to adjust prevalence estimates from this definition may be helpful to increase accuracy of estimates.},

The objective of this study is to systematically review validated International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-based case definitions for diabetes in the adult population. SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND OUTCOME MEASURES: Electronic databases, MEDLINE and Embase, were searched for validation studies where an administrative case definition (using ICD codes) for diabetes in adults was validated against a reference and statistical measures of the performance reported. RESULTS: The search yielded 2895 abstracts, and of the 193 potentially relevant studies, 16 met criteria. Diabetes definition for adults varied by data source, including physician claims (sensitivity ranged from 26.9% to 97%, specificity ranged from 94.3% to 99.4%, positive predictive value (PPV) ranged from 71.4% to 96.2%, negative predictive value (NPV) ranged from 95% to 99.6% and kappa ranged from 0.8 to 0.9), hospital discharge data (sensitivity ranged from 59.1% to 92.6%, specificity ranged from 95.5% to 99%, PPV ranged from 62.5% to 96%, NPV ranged from 90.8% to 99% and kappa ranged from 0.6 to 0.9) and a combination of both (sensitivity ranged from 57% to 95.6%, specificity ranged from 88% to 98.5%, PPV ranged from 54% to 80%, NPV ranged from 98% to 99.6% and kappa ranged from 0.7 to 0.8). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, administrative health databases are useful for undertaking diabetes surveillance, but an awareness of the variation in performance being affected by case definition is essential. The performance characteristics of these case definitions depend on the variations in the definition of primary diagnosis in ICD-coded discharge data and/or the methodology adopted by the healthcare facility to extract information from patient records.},

METHODS: From 48 urban and 16 rural general practitioners' clinics in Alberta and British Columbia, Canada, we randomly selected 50patient charts/clinic for those who visited the clinic in either 2001 or 2004. Reviewed chart data were linked with inpatient discharge abstract and physician claims administrative data. We identified patients with diabetes in the administrative databases using ICD-9 code 250.xx and ICD-10 codes E10.x-E14.x. RESULTS: The prevalence of diabetes was 8.1% among clinic charts. The coding algorithm of "2 physician claims within 2 years or 1 hospitalization with the relevant diabetes ICD codes" had higher validity than other 7 algorithms assessed (sensitivity 92.3%, specificity 96.9%, positive predictive value 77.2%, and negative predictive value 99.3%). After adjustment for age, sex, and comorbid conditions, sensitivity and positive predictive values were not significantly different between time periods and regions. CONCLUSION: Diabetes could be accurately identified in administrative data using the following case definition "2 physician claims within 2 years or 1 hospital discharge abstract record with diagnosis codes 250.xx or E10.x-E14.x".},

OBJECTIVE: To analyze time trends in angina-related hospitalizations and seek possible explanations for an observed, marked decline during 1992 to 1999. RESEARCH DESIGN: We analyzed Medicare claims of SEER-Medicare control subjects for occurrence of angina hospital discharges, using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Prevention Quality Indicator (PQI) definition, along with occurrence of related events including angina admissions with revascularization, angina admissions discharged as coronary artery disease (CAD) or myocardial infarction, and overall ischemic heart disease discharges. SUBJECTS: Approximately 124,000 cancer-free Medicare beneficiary/ies, with subjects contributing data for 1 to 8 years. RESULTS: Angina PQI hospital discharges declined 75% between 1992 and 1999. CAD hospital discharges rose in a reciprocal pattern, while angina discharges with revascularization declined and discharges for myocardial infarction and ischemic heart disease were relatively constant during this time period. CONCLUSIONS: The marked decline in angina PQI hospital discharges during 1992-1999 does not appear to represent improvements in access to care or prevention of heart disease, but rather increased coding of more specific discharge diagnoses for CAD. Our findings suggest that angina hospitalization is not a valid measure for monitoring access to care and, more generally, demonstrate the need for careful, periodic re-evaluation of quality measures.},

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate ICD-9 codes 410 and 411 to identify cases of acute coronary syndromes (ACS), and the clinical information availability in the administrative and hospital discharge records of Saskatchewan, Canada. METHODS: In the context of a safety cohort study, we identified hospitalisations with primary discharge codes 410 (2260) and 411 (799). We selected all records with code 411, and a random sample (200) with code 410. Based on information obtained by trained abstractors from hospital records, events were classified by two cardiologists as definite or possible according to adapted AHA/ESC criteria. The validity of 410 and 411 codes was assessed by calculating the positive predictive value (PPV). Completeness of the recorded information on risk factors and use of aspirin was explored. RESULTS: The PPVs of the codes 410 and 411 for ACS were 0.96 (95%CI: 0. 92-0.98) and 0.86 (95%CI: 0.83-0.88), respectively. The PPV of 410 for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was 0.95 (95%CI: 0.91-0.98). The PPV of 411 was 0.73 (95%CI: 0.70-0.77) for primary unstable angina (UA) and 0.09 (95%CI: 0.07-0.11) for AMI. Hospital charts review revealed key information for clinical variables, smoking, obesity and use of aspirin at admission. CONCLUSIONS: ICD-9 410 code has high PPV for AMI cases, likewise 411 for UA cases. Case validation remains important in epidemiological studies with administrative health databases. Given the pathophysiology of ACS, both AMI and UA might be used as study end points. In addition to code 410, we recommend the use of 411 plus validation.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The Medicare federal insurance program is the most common United States insurer of patients with systemic vasculitis (SV). We compared healthcare utilization and expenditures for Medicare beneficiaries with versus without SV. METHODS: This national, retrospective study used 2010 claims and enrollment data for a 100% cohort of Medicare Part A and B beneficiaries with >/=1 claim including a diagnosis for a form of SV (n = 176,498), and a randomly selected group of non-SV beneficiaries (n = 46,561). Outcomes included annual counts of events in 16 categories of medical services (e.g., inpatient stays, physician visits, tests, and imaging events), and total annual Medicare and patient medical expenditures. We used linear regression with bootstrapped standard errors to compare utilization and expenditures by SV status, before and after matching on age and sex. Prescription drug fills and expenditures for SV (n = 95,157) and non-SV (n = 24,992) beneficiaries with Part D drug benefits were also compared. RESULTS: After matching, Medicare spent $11,004 more per patient in 2010 for medical services, and $773 more on prescription drugs, for SV versus non-SV beneficiaries. SV beneficiaries spent $1547 more for medical services and $211 more for prescription drugs. Except for hospice, SV beneficiaries had greater utilization of all services, including two-to-three times more dialysis events, hospital readmissions, inpatient stays, skilled nursing facility stays, and medical tests. CONCLUSIONS: The average Medicare beneficiary with SV incurs about double the annual healthcare expenditures compared to their non-SV counterparts, attributable to increased utilization of almost all categories of care.},

  abstract = {Objective Histopathologic studies have implicated herpes zoster (HZ) as a causative organism of giant cell arteritis (GCA). The purpose of this study was to assess the epidemiologic association of HZ events with incident GCA. Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study in 2 large independent US administrative data sets: Medicare 5% and Truven Health Analytics MarketScan. Eligible subjects had 12 months of continuous coverage, were >50 years old, and had no history of GCA or polymyalgia rheumatica. HZ events (complicated and uncomplicated) and GCA were identified by the presence of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes from physician visit or hospital discharge records. Antiviral therapies and vaccinations were identified from prescription claims and drug codes. Risk of incident GCA was calculated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. Results Among 16,686,345 subjects, a total of 5,942 GCA cases occurred, with 3.1% (MarketScan) and 6.0% (Medicare) having preceding HZ events. Unadjusted GCA incidence rates were highest in the groups with complicated and uncomplicated HZ. After multivariable adjustment, complicated HZ was associated with an increased risk of GCA (hazard ratio [HR] 1.99 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.32–3.02] in the Medicare cohort and 2.16 [95% CI 1.46–3.18] in the MarketScan cohort), as was uncomplicated HZ (HR 1.42 [95% CI 1.02–1.99] and HR 1.45 [95% CI 1.05–2.01] in the respective cohorts). Vaccination and antiviral treatment were not consistently associated with GCA risk, although antiviral treatment was marginally associated with a decreased risk of GCA in the Medicare cohort (HR 0.67 [95% CI 0.46–0.99]). Conclusion HZ is associated with an increased risk of GCA. The infrequency of HZ in GCA patients suggests that it is only one potential trigger for GCA. Antivirals and vaccination did not consistently mitigate this risk.},

There is limited information on the validity of diagnosis codes for acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) in the SDD and administrative healthcare data more generally.In this chart validation study, we report on the positive predictive value (PPV) of inpatient administrative diagnosis codes for acute VTE-pulmonary embolism (PE) or lower-extremity or site-unspecified deep vein thrombosis (DVT)-within the SDD. As part of an assessment of thromboembolic adverse event risk following treatment with intravenous immune globulin (IGIV), charts were obtained for 75 potential VTE cases, abstracted, and physician-adjudicated.VTE status was determined for 62 potential cases. PPVs for lower-extremity DVT and/or PE were 90% (95% CI: 73-98%) for principal-position diagnoses, 80% (95% CI: 28-99%) for secondary diagnoses, and 26% (95% CI: 11-46%) for position-unspecified diagnoses (originating from physician claims associated with an inpatient stay). Average symptom onset was 1.5 days prior to hospital admission (range: 19 days prior to 4 days after admission).PPVs for principal and secondary VTE discharge diagnoses were similar to prior study estimates. Position-unspecified diagnoses were less likely to represent true acute VTE cases.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Low-risk pulmonary embolism (PE) patients may be candidates for outpatient treatment or abbreviated hospital stay. There is a need for a claims-based prediction rule that payers/hospitals can use to risk stratify PE patients. We sought to validate the In-hospital Mortality for PulmonAry embolism using Claims daTa (IMPACT) prediction rule for in-hospital and 30-day outcomes. METHODS: We used the Optum Research Database from 1/2008-3/2015 and included adults hospitalized for PE (415.1x in the primary position or secondary position when accompanied by a primary code for a PE complication) and having continuous medical and prescription coverage for >/=6-months prior and 3-months post-inclusion or until death. In-hospital and 30-day mortality and 30-day complications (recurrent venous thromboembolism, rehospitalization or death) were assessed and prognostic accuracies of IMPACT with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. RESULTS: In total, 47,531 PE patients were included. In-hospital and 30-day mortality occurred in 7.9 and 9.4 % of patients and 20.8 % experienced any complication within 30-days. Of the 19.5 % of patients classified as low-risk by IMPACT, 2.0 % died in-hospital, resulting in a sensitivity and specificity of 95.2 % (95 % CI, 94.4-95.8) and 20.7 % (95 % CI, 20.4-21.1). Only 1 additional low-risk patient died within 30-days of admission and 12.2 % experienced a complication, translating into a sensitivity and specificity of 95.9 % (95 % CI, 95.3-96.5) and 21.1 % (95 % CI, 20.7-21.5) for mortality and 88.5 % (95 % CI, 87.9-89.2) and 21.6 % (95 % CI, 21.2-22.0) for any complication. CONCLUSION: IMPACT had acceptable sensitivity for predicting in-hospital and 30-day mortality or complications and may be valuable for retrospective risk stratification of PE patients.},

All of the studies reported on ICD-9 codes, but only two studies reported on pharmacy codes, and one study reported on procedure codes. The highest PPV (65%-95%) was reported for the combined use of ICD-9 codes 415 (pulmonary embolism), 451, and 453 (deep vein thrombosis) as a VTE event. If a specific event like DVT (PPV 24%-92%) or PE (PPV 31%-97%) was evaluated, the PPV was lower than when the combined events were examined.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used detailed clinical data from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) linked to Medicare claims. Agreement between data sources was evaluated among 16,003 women during 1993-2010. A claims-based definition was selected to analyze VTE occurrence and impact among 71,267 women during 1993-2012. RESULTS: Our VTE definition had 83% sensitivity. Positive predictive value was 69% when all records were included, and 94% after limiting Medicare records to those with a WHI hospitalization adjudicated. Annualized VTE incidence was 4.06/1000person-years (PY), recurrence was 5.30/100PY, and both rates varied by race/ethnicity. Post-VTE mortality within 1year was 22.49% from all causes, including 1.01% from pulmonary embolism, 10.40% from cancer, and 11.08% from other causes. Cancer-related VTE compared to non-cancer VTE had significantly (p<0.001) higher recurrence (9.86/100PY vs. 4.43/100PY) and mortality from all causes (45.89% vs. 12.28%), but not from pulmonary embolism (0.40% vs. 1.27%). CONCLUSIONS: Medicare claims compared reasonably well to physician adjudication. The combined data sources provided new insights about VTE burden and prognosis in older women.},

However, it is unclear whether these symptoms occurred preceding the diagnosis of peripheral artery occlusive disease (PAOD). Therefore, the aim of this case-control study was to investigate the risk of PAOD among patients with vertigo, tinnitus, and sudden deafness using a nationwide, population-based health claim database in Taiwan. METHODS: We identified 5,340 adult patients with PAOD diagnosed between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2010 and 16,020 controls, frequency matched on age interval, sex, and year of index date, from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Risks of PAOD in patients with vertigo, tinnitus, or sudden deafness were separately evaluated with multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Of the 5,340 patients with PAOD, 12.7%, 6.7%, and 0.3% were diagnosed with vertigo, tinnitus, and sudden deafness, respectively. In the controls, 10.6%, 6.1%, and 0.3% were diagnosed with vertigo (P < 0.001), tinnitus (P = 0.161), and sudden deafness (P = 0.774), respectively. Results from the multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that the risk of PAOD was significantly increased in patients with vertigo (adjusted odds ratio = 1.12, P = 0.027) but not in those with tinnitus or sudden deafness. CONCLUSIONS: A modest increase in the risk of PAOD was observed among Taiwanese patients with vertigo, after adjustment for comorbidities.},

              physician review and adjudication of medical records for
              identifying venous thromboembolism (VTE), and to assess VTE
              incidence, recurrence, and mortality in a large national cohort
              of post-menopausal women followed up to 19years. MATERIALS AND
              METHODS: We used detailed clinical data from the Women's Health
              Initiative (WHI) linked to Medicare claims. Agreement between
              data sources was evaluated among 16,003 women during 1993-2010. A
              claims-based definition was selected to analyze VTE occurrence
              and impact among 71,267 women during 1993-2012. RESULTS: Our VTE
              definition had 83\% sensitivity. Positive predictive value was
              69\% when all records were included, and 94\% after limiting
              Medicare records to those with a WHI hospitalization adjudicated.
              Annualized VTE incidence was 4.06/1000person-years (PY),
              recurrence was 5.30/100PY, and both rates varied by
              race/ethnicity. Post-VTE mortality within 1year was 22.49\% from
              all causes, including 1.01\% from pulmonary embolism, 10.40\%
              from cancer, and 11.08\% from other causes. Cancer-related VTE
              compared to non-cancer VTE had significantly (p<0.001) higher
              recurrence (9.86/100PY vs. 4.43/100PY) and mortality from all
              causes (45.89\% vs. 12.28\%), but not from pulmonary embolism
              (0.40\% vs. 1.27\%). CONCLUSIONS: Medicare claims compared
              reasonably well to physician adjudication. The combined data
              sources provided new insights about VTE burden and prognosis in
              older women.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Low-risk pulmonary embolism (PE) patients may be
              candidates for outpatient treatment or abbreviated hospital stay.
              There is a need for a claims-based prediction rule that
              payers/hospitals can use to risk stratify PE patients. We sought
              to validate the In-hospital Mortality for PulmonAry embolism
              using Claims daTa (IMPACT) prediction rule for in-hospital and
              30-day outcomes. METHODS: We used the Optum Research Database
              from 1/2008-3/2015 and included adults hospitalized for PE
              (415.1x in the primary position or secondary position when
              accompanied by a primary code for a PE complication) and having
              continuous medical and prescription coverage for >/=6-months
              prior and 3-months post-inclusion or until death. In-hospital and
              30-day mortality and 30-day complications (recurrent venous
              thromboembolism, rehospitalization or death) were assessed and
              prognostic accuracies of IMPACT with 95 \% confidence intervals
              (CIs) were calculated. RESULTS: In total, 47,531 PE patients were
              included. In-hospital and 30-day mortality occurred in 7.9 and
              9.4 \% of patients and 20.8 \% experienced any complication
              within 30-days. Of the 19.5 \% of patients classified as low-risk
              by IMPACT, 2.0 \% died in-hospital, resulting in a sensitivity
              and specificity of 95.2 \% (95 \% CI, 94.4-95.8) and 20.7 \% (95
              \% CI, 20.4-21.1). Only 1 additional low-risk patient died within
              30-days of admission and 12.2 \% experienced a complication,
              translating into a sensitivity and specificity of 95.9 \% (95 \%
              CI, 95.3-96.5) and 21.1 \% (95 \% CI, 20.7-21.5) for mortality
              and 88.5 \% (95 \% CI, 87.9-89.2) and 21.6 \% (95 \% CI,
              21.2-22.0) for any complication. CONCLUSION: IMPACT had
              acceptable sensitivity for predicting in-hospital and 30-day
              mortality or complications and may be valuable for retrospective
              risk stratification of PE patients.",

              physician claims associated with an inpatient stay). Average
              symptom onset was 1.5 days prior to hospital admission (range: 19
              days prior to 4 days after admission).PPVs for principal and
              secondary VTE discharge diagnoses were similar to prior study
              estimates. Position-unspecified diagnoses were less likely to

              researchers will not have access to death information in the
              enrollment files. We developed and evaluated a claims-based
              definition of death. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used
              healthcare claims and enrollment data between January 2005 and
              August 2009 for 195,193 beneficiaries aged 20 to 74 in 3 private
              health insurance unions. We developed claims-based definitions of
              death using discharge or disease status and Charlson comorbidity
              index (CCI). We calculated sensitivity, specificity and positive
              predictive values (PPVs) using the enrollment data as a gold
              standard in the overall population and subgroups divided by
              demographic and other factors. We also assessed bias and
              precision in two example studies where an outcome was death. The
              definition based on the combination of discharge/disease status
              and CCI provided moderate sensitivity (around 60\%) and high
              specificity (99.99\%) and high PPVs (94.8\%). In most subgroups,
              sensitivity of the preferred definition was also around 60\% but
              varied from 28 to 91\%. In an example study comparing death rates
              between two anticancer drug classes, the claims-based definition
              provided valid and precise hazard ratios (HRs). In another
              example study comparing two classes of anti-depressants, the HR
              with the claims-based definition was biased and had lower
              precision than that with the gold standard definition.
              CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The claims-based definitions of death
              developed in this study had high specificity and PPVs while
              sensitivity was around 60\%. The definitions will be useful in
              future studies when used with attention to the possible
              fluctuation of sensitivity in some subpopulations.",

              all-cause mortality in type 2 diabetes",
  author   = "Robinson, T E and Elley, C R and Kenealy, T and Drury, P L",
  abstract = "AIMS: Type 2 diabetes is common and is associated with an
              approximate 80\% increase in the rate of mortality. Management
              decisions may be assisted by an estimate of the patient's
              absolute risk of adverse outcomes, including death. This study
              aimed to derive a predictive risk model for all-cause mortality
              in type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We used primary care data from a
              large national multi-ethnic cohort of patients with type 2
              diabetes in New Zealand and linked mortality records to develop a
              predictive risk model for 5-year risk of mortality. We then
              validated this model using information from a separate cohort of
              patients with type 2 diabetes. RESULTS: 26,864 people were
              included in the development cohort with a median follow up time
              of 9.1 years. We developed three models initially using
              demographic information and then progressively more clinical
              detail. The final model, which also included markers of renal
              disease, proved to give best prediction of all-cause mortality
              with a C-statistic of 0.80 in the development cohort and 0.79 in
              the validation cohort (7610 people) and was well calibrated.
              Ethnicity was a major factor with hazard ratios of 1.37 for
              indigenous Maori, 0.41 for East Asian and 0.55 for Indo Asian
              compared with European (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We have developed
              a model using information usually available in primary care that
              provides good assessment of patient's risk of death. Results are
              similar to models previously published from smaller cohorts in

              receiving continuous ACE/ARB therapy (n = 1,491,894).
              Hyperkalemia risk associated with concurrent use of
              spironolactone and ACE/ARB was calculated by conditional logistic
              regression in 1062 cases and 10,620 risk-set-sampling-matched
              controls. RESULTS: Risk of hyperkalemia in heart failure patients
              was significantly associated with spironolactone use (odds ratio
              (OR) (95\% confidence interval (CI)) = 13.59 (11.63-15.88) in all
              and 11.05 (8.67-14.08) in those with information on New York
              Heart Association (NYHA) stage of disease). In the NYHA
              subpopulation, higher risk estimates were observed in short-term
              as compared with long-term users (OR (95\%CI) = 13.00
              (9.82-17.21) and 9.12 (6.78-12.26), respectively). Moreover, the
              association was stronger in older (>/=70 years of age) as
              compared with younger patients (<70 years of age) (OR (95\%CI) =
              12.32 (9.35-16.23) and 8.73 (5.05-15.08), respectively), although
              interaction was not significant (pinteraction = 0.07).
              CONCLUSIONS: Hyperkalemia risk associated with combined use of
              spironolactone and ACE/ARB is much stronger in real-life practice
              than observed in clinical trials. Careful potassium level
              monitoring in concomitant users of spironolactone and ACE/ARB is
              necessary.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The retrospective study aimed to estimate prevalence
              of hyperkalemia using a large US commercial claims database.
              METHODS: Adults with serum potassium lab data (2010 to 2014) and
              >/=1 calendar year of data were included from a large US
              commercial claims database. Hyperkalemia was defined as >/=2
              serum potassium measurements >5.0 mEq/L or one hyperkalemia
              diagnosis code (ICD-9-CM, 276.7) or one sodium polystyrene
              sulfonate fill. Hyperkalemia prevalence was estimated for the
              overall population and subgroups with hyperkalemia-related
              comorbidities by calendar year. Hyperkalemia prevalence was also
              standardized to the US population to estimate the number of US
              adults with hyperkalemia. RESULTS: The analysis included
              2,270,635 patients (2010-2014). The annual prevalence of
              hyperkalemia in the overall population was 1.57\% in 2014, with
              higher rates observed in patients with chronic kidney disease
              (CKD), heart failure, diabetes and hypertension. Among patients
              with CKD and/or heart failure, the 2014 annual prevalence was
              6.35\%. Among patients with hyperkalemia, 48.43\% had CKD and/or
              heart failure in 2014. The prevalence of hyperkalemia was higher
              in patients with more severe CKD, as well as older patients and
              men. Extrapolating those results to the US population supports
              that 1.55\% or 3.7 million US adults had hyperkalemia in 2014.
              CONCLUSIONS: An estimated 3.7 million US adults had hyperkalemia
              in 2014, and this prevalence rate has increased since 2010. In
              patients with CKD and/or heart failure, the annual prevalence of
              hyperkalemia was 6.35\% in 2014, and about half of all patients
              with hyperkalemia have either CKD and/or heart failure.",

  author   = "Fitch, K and Woolley, J M and Engel, T and Blumen, H",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Hyperkalemia (serum potassium >5.0 mEq/L) may be
              caused by reduced kidney function and drugs affecting the
              renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and is often present in
              patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). OBJECTIVE: To
              quantify the burden of hyperkalemia in US Medicare
              fee-for-service and commercially insured populations using
              real-world claims data, focusing on prevalence, comorbidities,
              mortality, medical utilization, and cost. METHODS: A descriptive,
              retrospective claims data analysis was performed on patients with
              hyperkalemia using the 2014 Medicare 5\% sample and the 2014
              Truven Health Analytics MarketScan Commercial Claims and
              Encounter databases. The starting study samples required patient
              insurance eligibility during >/=1 months in 2014. The
              identification of hyperkalemia and other comorbidities required
              having >/=1 qualifying claims in 2014 with an appropriate
              International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,
              Clinical Modification diagnosis code in any position. To address
              the differences between patients with and without hyperkalemia,
              CKD subsamples were analyzed separately. Mortality rates were
              calculated in the Medicare sample population only. The claims
              were grouped into major service categories; the allowed costs
              reflected all costs incurred by each cohort divided by the total
              number of member months for that cohort. RESULTS: The prevalence
              of hyperkalemia in the Medicare and commercially insured samples
              was 2.3\% and 0.09\%, respectively. Hyperkalemia was associated
              with multiple comorbidities, most notably CKD. The prevalence of
              CKD in the Medicare and the commercially insured members with
              hyperkalemia was 64.8\% and 31.8\%, respectively. After adjusting
              for CKD severity, the annual mortality rate for Medicare patients
              with CKD and hyperkalemia was 24.9\% versus 10.4\% in patients
              with CKD without hyperkalemia. The allowed costs in patients with
              CKD and hyperkalemia in the Medicare and commercially insured
              cohorts were more than twice those in patients with CKD without
              hyperkalemia. Inpatient care accounted for >50\% of costs in
              patients with CKD and hyperkalemia. CONCLUSION: Hyperkalemia is
              associated with substantial clinical and economic burden among US
              commercially insured and Medicare populations.",
